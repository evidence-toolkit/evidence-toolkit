You need to:
- ✗ Review every piece of evidence manually (6-8 hours)
- ✗ Build a timeline from unstructured data
- ✗ Find contradictions between witness statements
- ✗ Assess legal risks and tribunal viability
- ✗ Prepare a coherent case summary for counsel

**That's £300-400 in paralegal time. Every. Single. Case.**

## FAQ Section

### "Is this legal advice?"
No. Evidence Toolkit is an analysis tool that helps you review evidence faster. All findings should be independently verified by qualified legal professionals. Think of it as AI-powered paralegal work, not legal counsel.

### "What types of cases work best?"
Employment law (unfair dismissal, whistleblowing, discrimination), workplace investigations, contract disputes, regulatory compliance cases. Basically anything with documents, emails, photos, or messages as evidence.

### "How accurate is the AI analysis?"
The AI identifies patterns, contradictions, and entities with 85-95% accuracy. We flag confidence levels for every finding. Critical decisions should always be human-verified, but the AI catches patterns humans miss in large evidence sets.

### "What file formats are supported?"
- Documents: PDF, Word (.docx), text files
- Images: JPG, PNG (OCR for text extraction)
- Emails: .eml, .msg, or exported to PDF
- Coming soon: Video/audio transcription
