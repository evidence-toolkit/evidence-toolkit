## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

### What Makes This Compelling:

1. **Instant Gratification**: 30-min turnaround vs 6-8 hour manual process
2. **Specific Value**: Â£300-400 paralegal cost â†’ Â£150-300 AI analysis
3. **Risk-Free Trial**: Â£150 first case with 30-day refund
4. **Recurring Revenue**: Â£30/mo Tidy subscription for retention
5. **Scalable Service**: You + Claude can handle 40-50 cases/month

### Why This Can Work:

1. **Real Problem**: Employment solicitors genuinely spend hours reviewing evidence
2. **Proven Tech**: We have working pipeline, real case (Sainsburys) proves it works
3. **Clear Pricing**: No hourly billing confusion, fixed per-case cost
4. **Low Barrier**: Â£150 is impulse purchase territory for professionals
5. **Differentiation**: No competitor offers AI evidence analysis at this price point

### Risks to Manage:

1. **Quality Control**: Every output must be QA'd before delivery (you + Claude)
2. **Support Burden**: FAQ must be comprehensive to reduce "how do I..." emails
3. **Scope Creep**: "Can you also analyze video?" â†’ Stick to documents/images initially
4. **Legal Liability**: ToS must clearly state "not legal advice, for review only"
5. **Capacity**: At 40+ cases/month, need to automate QA or hire help

## ðŸš€ Your Move

**This week's focus**: Get web implementation done.

**Priority order**:
1. **Deploy landing page** (Carrd = 2 hours, done today)
2. **Add Stripe payment** (1 hour, test with Â£1 charge)
3. **Upload endpoint** (4 hours, basic Flask app)
4. **Email delivery** (1 hour, SendGrid free tier)
5. **Soft launch LinkedIn** (10 people, get feedback)

**By Friday**: Should have first test customer paying Â£150 and receiving report.

**By end of month**: 5-10 customers, Â£750-1500 revenue, product-market fit validated.

You've got the hard part done (working tech). Now it's execution on distribution.
