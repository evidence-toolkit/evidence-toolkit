üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
------------------------------
The workplace dispute at Major UK Retailer‚Äôs store in Store Location X involves serious allegations of neglected hygiene, food safety violations, and potential employment law breaches. The claimant, Employee A, a key employee, has accused the management of retaliating against his whistleblowing activities concerning unsanitary conditions that allegedly persist despite internal reports and communications. The core issues encompass potential unfair dismissal claims, discrimination under the Equality Act 2010, and breaches of duty of care, all suggesting misalignment with employment and health regulations. 

Management has failed to effectively address claims of hygiene lapses, resulting in multiple legal risks. The presence of rust, grime, and mold on store shelving and food storage areas could contravene health and safety standards, risking consumer well-being and regulatory compliance. The organizational response to employee grievances, such as inadequate cleaning measures and alleged retaliatory suspension of Employee A, reflects serious HR procedural shortcomings, exacerbating tensions and dissatisfaction among store personnel. This dispute highlights systemic failings within the management hierarchy and a culture of overlooking critical compliance warnings.

     ‚Ä¢ Text detected: Yeo Valley
GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT
In this pot is the thickest, creamiest yogurt we've ever made - just like traditional Greek but all our own.
Our secret? We've kerned* it, very slowly, up to nine times.
It makes for a super luxurious spoonful that's naturally boosted in protein and even lower in natural sugars.
*Kerned, you say? It's old Somerset for "thickened". But then we have a funny word for everything.

     ‚Ä¢ Text detected: I thought avoiding conflict meant keeping the peace, but it turns out it only made me a prisoner to my own silence.

I swallowed my feelings to keep others comfortable, stayed silent when I should have spoken up.

I let things slide that should have been confronted because I didn't want to rock the boat.

The truth is avoiding conflict doesn't create peace, it creates resentment, it creates anxiety.

It creates a version of you that's so afraid of disappointing others, that you end up disappointing yourself.

I refuse to live like that anymore, my peace is not found in being agreeable. My peace is found in honesty and choosing to honor my own voice as much as I honour everybody else's.

If I have to betray myself to keep the peace, It was neve peace to begin with.

     ‚Ä¢ Text detected: Sometimes small issues at work can more effectively be resolved without the need for other people to become involved. We encourage colleagues to take steps to resolve an issue themselves, where it is appropriate and they feel confident to do so. For example, if you experience an issue with another colleague then consider whether it is something that could be resolved by speaking directly with the colleague themselves. A private face to face discussion in a polite and positive way may be all that is needed to address the issue. If you are unsure about how to approach this type of discussion then you should speak to your manager who will be able to provide support on steps to make sure the conversation is effective. Of course not all issues can be resolved following the approach above, so if this is not appropriate or not successful for the type of concern you have then you should talk to your manager. Before meeting with the manager to whom you have raised the complaint, think about how you would like the issue to be resolved and what steps you think could be taken to make this happen. The manager will look into the issue that you have raised. They will do what they can to sort the problem out quickly and explain to you the steps that are being taken. If your complaint is about another colleague, it can be helpful to have an informal conciliation meeting with them. This means that you and the colleague have the opportunity to discuss the situation with a manager present. The manager will act as an independent third party and encourage you both to explain your side of the situation in order to come to a resolution. Sometimes, if the complaint is about someone's behaviour, the person may not even realise the effect they've been having. Talking it through in an open and honest way can help them to recognise the problem. Together, you can agree ways of working to prevent future issues occurring. This type of meeting will only take place if you both agree to it as it requires a positive and proactive approach in order to be successful. The aim of the informal route is to resolve your complaint quickly and constructively. The manager dealing with the complaint will meet with you to discuss what they believe can be done to resolve the problem and check that you are comfortable with this approach before putting any agreed actions into place. Sometimes a conciliation meeting or the mediation process may be suggested by the manager (see above). In most cases, we hope that the agreed approach should resolve the issue. However, if things don't improve then you should let the manager know. There may be other informal options available, or they may decide to start the formal process. Another approach to resolve an issue which your Line Manager can discuss with you is Mediation. Mediation is a voluntary and confidential structured process in which a neutral third party (the mediator) intervenes in an impartial way to help two or more people in a dispute attempt to reach an agreement. Any agreement comes from those in dispute and not from the mediator. The mediator will do this by encouraging and facilitating an open and honest conversation between the parties, so that both sides have a greater understanding and empathy of the other person's position. The mediator will not take sides and will not judge whether anyone was right or wrong in the past, rather focuses on reaching an agreement about the future working relationship. This is different from conciliation, as it is a more in depth and detailed process, using a formal methodology which requires a trained mediator. It would usually be used for more complex issues and may be appropriate at any stage in the process, both informal and formal. We have a formal approach for dealing with complaints in situations where the informal approach does not successfully resolve it. In exceptional cases, it may be appropriate to go straight to the formal stage. This would be the case where the manager reviews your allegation and feels it to be a case of discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, victimisation or other types of complaints very serious in nature or where the informal approach would not be appropriate.

     ‚Ä¢ Text detected: Fair Treatment
For us to handle any complaint appropriately when raising a complaint, you will need to let us know how you feel you
have been treated unfairly and also how you feel the issue may be resolved.
If you disagree with a practice, policy or decision, this would not be subject to this policy. You may be asked to use the
appeal process where this is available, or you may be asked to provide more detail about how you feel you have been
treated unfairly for the complaint to be progressed further as a fair treatment complaint.
Wherever possible you should try and raise complaints by discussing them with your Line Manager locally, informally
and as soon as possible.
Collective and individual grievances
If you are a Food Retail colleague and a member of a Union and wish to raise an individual or collective grievance please
refer to your National Agreement.
There may be different approaches available dependant on which Union you are a member of and the relevant National
agreement that is applied regarding individual and collective grievances. Please refer to your National agreement for
more details. A fair treatment complaint may be applied where there is an issue regarding the application of a policy
and a collective/individual grievance may be regarding the actual policy itself (depending on the relevant union
agreement applied).
For other areas that are collectively bargained please refer to your National agreement or Local agreement for the
collective grievance processes.
What if my complaint is about my line manager?
If you feel you can't raise your complaint with your line manager, you should raise it with their line manager or another
member of the management team. You may also email your complaint to ER.Support@Major UK Retailer.co.uk
Resolving issues at work informally
We expect all our colleagues to be part of making the company a great place to work. As part of this, it is everyone's
responsibility to create an open and honest environment where issues can be dealt with as soon as they arise. Often
the best way to do so is informally and therefore in most cases we will try to resolve your complaint informally first.
The guidance below provides steps that can be taken to do so.

Store health and safety risk assessments have been completed centrally. Store managers are expected to implement the risk control measures and communicate them to colleagues. The risk assessments identify hazards and assess risk for all tasks/activities in the store.
It is recognised that not all risks can be sufficiently assessed using a generic assessment system, and therefore some local differences may exist. Where local circumstances affect the risk ratings in the store, Store Managers are expected to record local conditions on the risk assessment. A generic risk rating must not be lowered.
Work Equipment Assessments
The Company's equipment procurement process requires that all equipment brought into the company is subject to risk assessment. Recommendations and control measures from the assessments are incorporated into safe working practices and

It asserts that Paul raised legitimate health and safety concerns protected under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, accusing the employer of retaliation and whistleblower victimisation. It highlights an external manager's validation of Paul's claims and criticises disciplinary actions taken post-investigation, suggesting discrimination linked to Paul's neurodivergence (Dyslexia, ADHD, likely Autism) under the Equality Act 2010. The statement calls for recognition of reasonable adjustments, consistency in treatment, and protection against disability discrimination and unlawful victimisation due to whistleblowing.

   Key findings:
     ‚Ä¢ The document is a series of emails between Employee A, an Online Assistant at Major UK Retailer Store Location X Store, and Nick Ringrose, Operational Field Safety Manager at Major UK Retailer Group Safety & Insurance, concerning serious health and safety and food safety issues identified by Paul at the Store Location X store. Paul has raised concerns over a prolonged period, supported by extensive photographic evidence, and has escalated these to senior management and ER (Employee Relations). Nick acknowledges receipt, advises Paul to file a fair treatment complaint regarding his treatment, and plans an unannounced store inspection. The correspondence discusses potential breaches of health and safety laws, proper protocols when contamination incidents occur, and concerns about retaliation or unfair treatment. The email exchange reveals ongoing organizational responses and concerns for compliance with legal obligations such as RIDDOR reporting and the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 protections. The document is key legal evidence of whistleblowing, internal investigation, and management's handling of significant safety risks.

I am nexting
I can't start all over. However, I can start from where I am. And where am I?
I am in the next breath I take. I am the next heartbeat I feel under my softening ribs. I am in the next word I utter. I am in the next thing I give my attention to. I am in the next. I am the next choice I make. The next kindness. The next hug. The next silence. The next tear. The next prayer I utter. The next word I write. The next step. The next song. I am not starting over--I am continuing. I am nexting.

Good Afternoon Paul,
Thank you for highlighting your concerns. I take this matter seriously and will reach out to Ryan Allen to arrange a visit to the store as soon as possible.
In the meantime, please let me know if there is anything else I need to be aware of.
Kind regards,

Subject: Escalation: Ongoing Food Safety Breach - Store Location X Store
Dear Paul and David,
I am writing to escalate an unresolved health and food safety issue at the Store Location X store, which has persisted for over four months despite formal internal reporting and discussions with local management.
Attached is the original report I submitted in February 2025 outlining serious hygiene concerns in the chilled section, including recurring contamination, blood residue, and visible mould growth. Although assurances were given that a cleaning schedule would be implemented, conditions remain largely unchanged. I've included updated photo evidence from April and June 2025 showing continued debris, mould, and inadequate cleaning practices.
As an online assistant responsible for handling both chilled and ambient foods in succession, I'm concerned this poses an ongoing risk to customers, particularly those relying on online deliveries who cannot inspect items in person. Given the length and visibility of this issue, it now reflects a failure in both hygiene standards and basic operational management.
Due to system limits, I've uploaded the report and supporting files via the links below. Please let me know if there are access issues or if alternate formats are preferred - I can resend or compress files if needed.
Please note: I've not copied in store-level management at this stage but am happy to do so if needed for clarity or coordination. I'm raising this in good faith as someone who cares about standards, but as a part-time, GOL colleague, I'm not in a position to lead or support the operational follow-up. I trust this will be addressed through the appropriate management channels.
Thank you for your time. I look forward to a formal response.
Kind regards,
Employee A

no, i didn't. i was barely holding on. i cried when no one could hear me, lost the parts of me i used to love, and pretended i was okay when i wasn't. i smiled, because it was easier than explaining the pain. i went through days that felt too long, nights that felt too empty, and moments when i wondered if i'd ever feel whole again. i hid behind routines, laughter, and words that never reached the truth of how i felt. i learned to survive quietly, to push myself out of bed when my heart didn't want to, to keep moving even when it hurt to breathe. i was tired, but somehow i kept going. i showed up, even when i didn't want to, even when every part of me whispered to give up. i survived, even when it felt impossible. so no, i didn't handle it well.

What if I think that I need hand / arm protection for a area / task not mentioned in this procedure?
In order to determine whether providing hand or arm PPE is the answer, it will be necessary to complete a risk assessment.
Once the assessment has been completed, and it has recommended that protection does need to be provided, a copy of the assessment should be sent to Group Safety, who will determine what standards it needs to comply with, and then forward that information on to the Procurement Division so that they can purchase the correct item.
This ensures that the requirement is examined across the Retail Division as a whole, to see if there are any further locations where similar specialist hand / arm protection applies.
What if I think that there may be quality issues with the hand / arm protection supplied?
Please make contact with the Dimensions Corporatewear Helpline on 01332 856930 or Major UK Retailer@dimensions.co.uk. They will need full details including order code, type of item, quantity involved, whether worn and if

     ‚Ä¢ Text detected: Your representative
You can take a representative to the meeting to support you. Your representative can be a colleague (who works at any of the companies within the Major UK Retailer business) of any level or a trade union representative. If you're under 18 or have a disability you can bring a parent, guardian or support worker. If you have a hearing impairment and require an interpreter - such as a sign language interpreter, lipspeaker, speech to text reporter, sign language translator or interpreter for Deafblind people - then you can bring the interpreter and this would be in addition to the representative. However, they must be NRCPD (The National Registers of Communication Professionals working with Deaf and Deafblind People) registered. The NRCPD check interpreters against the national minimum safe practice standards to make sure they are properly qualified and competent to do the job needed. Your line manager can book an NRCPD registered interpreter through the website www.nrcpd.org.uk and the cost of this will be paid for either by the government's Access to Work scheme or by us.
Your representative can help you prepare for the meeting and we'll give them a reasonable amount of paid time away from work (if they are a colleague). It's your responsibility to make sure your representative has all the relevant information and documentation in advance of your meeting.
During the meeting they'll support you. They can speak on your behalf and present your case but where you're asked a direct question you should answer this yourself. They're allowed to see the statements and documents involved in the process and can ask for the meeting to be adjourned if they think it's necessary.
For more information refer to the Role of a Representative guide on Our Major UK Retailer.

Found everything I needed.
Asked about voucher issue.
The flooding in the carpark is a cause for concern! It's been a problem for a long time & no one is doing anything about it! Why? Because it costs money? Come on Major UK Retailer you make enough profit to deal with this more efficiently! Also it's sad to hear that the cafe is closing. This has been a thriving social area where people can meet to enjoy some refreshments together without it costing a fortune. It's sad that no one in management ever listens to the customers. We have no say in any matter.
I've tried very hard over the years to get Major UK Retailer to stock products I enjoy & recommend to my friends but I've been told it's not possible due to some companies paying Major UK Retailer more to stock their products. Groceries should be a fair market. Thankfully I can get this product at Tesco so Major UK Retailer is losing out which is a pity as I love my Major UK Retailer store!
Clean store good choice good quality really good to use scanner.
I could easily find what I needed & the queues for checking out weren't long.

   Key findings:
     ‚Ä¢ This document is a formal outcome letter following a Fair Treatment meeting held on 30 June 2025 concerning an employee's raised concerns about cleaning standards and management response at a Major UK Retailer store. The investigations concluded that the line managers did not respond or escalate the employee's issues in a timely manner, and the employee was treated differently during coaching conversations. The letter partially upholds these points and outlines the company's commitment to addressing concerns fairly, supporting colleagues, and following safety protocols. The employee is informed of their right to appeal and offered wellbeing support. The letter serves as a formal record of the investigation and its findings with implications for workplace fairness and compliance with company policy.

Keep it up. Clean well laid out store, the staff are friendly & they recognise me, I have a Major UK Retailer credit card & nectar that I use with my shopping.
Self service till needed attention.
I prefer to use a local for my top up shopping, I find the carpark troublesome to park & negotiate when a pedestrian so don't visit often. I did find what I wanted in the end but did take some time. Due to long queues at the couple of manned tills I was forced to use self scan which required a team member to help. Products I purchased were of good quality.

     ‚Ä¢ Employee A submitted a formal complaint of unfair treatment following the mishandling of health and safety concerns he raised at the Store Location X store. Despite raising serious food safety issues in good faith, his concerns were initially dismissed by local management, causing personal stress and a failure of the employer's duty of care. Paul seeks a formal review, acknowledgment of impact, clarity on future handling of such issues, and a discussion of photographic evidence related to hygiene risks. The complaint references possible protected disclosure implications and requests remedial action from Employment Relations support and executives.

     ‚Ä¢ Scene: The image shows a digital screenshot of a document page titled 'Referral to formal process' and related sections discussing fair treatment complaints and processes. The page is part of a multi-page document viewed within a PDF reader interface on a computer desktop with visible sidebars and icons. The document text explains steps to resolve complaints, how to raise them, and details of a fair treatment process summary in a formal, professional layout with orange highlights and a small logo at the bottom right labeled 'Major UK Retailer'.
     ‚Ä¢ Text detected: Referral to formal process
If, after informal attempts have been made to resolve a complaint, a resolution has not been reached then a manager may refer the complaint to a formal process.
If the manager has reviewed the case and believes that there is evidence to suggest matters still need to be resolved, the case will be referred to a fair treatment hearing.
Sometimes, a manager may decide that trying to resolve the complaint informally isn‚Äôt be appropriate. If this is the case your manager will always discuss this with you first before starting the formal process.
Fair Treatment process summary
Some Food Logistics Depots that are covered by a collective agreement have additional steps in their process. Please see appendix 1 for additional details of the process required for these locations
Step 1 Understanding your complaint and possible resolution
In order to assess the nature of the complaint, the manager dealing with it will need to understand your complaint in more detail. This may involve meeting with you to discuss it or asking you to write it down, or provide more details.
It is really important when completing this step to be specific about facts related to the complaint, for example, times and dates of incidents or witnesses. This will enable the issues you raise to be investigated properly. You should also be clear about how you feel you have been treated unfairly and how the matter can be resolved.
Step 2 Attend a formal complaint meeting
You will be invited to attend a meeting to discuss your complaint as soon as possible. This will be held by an appropriate manager and you can have a work colleague or a trade union representative come along with you to this meeting. Where appropriate it may be the same manager in the informal and formal stage. Prior to the meeting, the manager will investigate the issues that you have raised. They may also decide to adjourn after meeting with you, if they need to gather any further information based on what you have discussed.
Step 3 Adjournment
When the manager has all of the information to make a decision they will ask you and/or your representative if you/they have anything to add, and then will adjourn the meeting.
It is this time the manager will use to make their decision.
Step 4 Outcome
In some cases, the manager hearing the complaint will give you their conclusion at the end of this meeting. If they need more time to think it over, or gather more evidence, they will do all they can to give you their written conclusion within seven days of the meeting. The outcome letter will detail the manager‚Äôs decision (if the complaint is upheld or not upheld), what action the manager intends to take to resolve the fair treatment complaint and the appeals process. In exceptional circumstances there may be occasions where the manager may need to meet with you to discuss the outcome. If the manager does not find sufficient evidence to support the complaint, they will advise you of the reasons why. We aim to process each individual stage of the complaints resolution procedure within 14 days.
Do I have to put my Fair Treatment complaint in writing?
You can raise Fair Treatment complaints either verbally or in writing to the appropriate manager, whichever feels more comfortable. However it is raised, the most important thing is understanding the complaint in order to assess the most appropriate approach to resolve it. If a complaint is raised in writing it doesn‚Äôt mean it will automatically be dealt with formally, this will be based on the nature of the complaint. Likewise, if you choose to raise your complaint verbally it can still be escalated formally, which may involve putting some things in writing to help support any investigation.

Health and Safety - Retail Risk Assessm...
Pregnant Women and Nursing Mothers
Assessments are conducted for pregnant women or nursing mothers and documented individually. The assessments are conducted by line managers and are kept on site in an employee's file.
Walkthrough Risk Assessments
'Walkthrough' risk assessments are standalone risk assessments, valid only for the duration of an ad hoc event. Store managers undertake these types of risk assessments when the potential risks arising from an activity are outside the normal activities for the store.
Store Delivery Risk Assessments
The Transport Risk Assessor will undertake the assessment at a time when a delivery / collection is being made (the assessor must not be the delivering / collecting driver). The transport risk assessor and the store manager will agree the necessary control measures required to reduce the risk of manoeuvring delivery vehicles at the store. The store manager will sign the assessment form to confirm that they agree with the assessment.

1. Zero tolerance to discrimination bullying, harassment, sexual harassment, and victimisation
For more information please see our Guide to Discrimination, Bullying, Harassment, Sexual Harassment and victimisation available on Our Major UK Retailer. This guide provides more detail on what we mean by these types of behaviours and what is not acceptable behaviour.
We take allegations of discrimination, bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and victimisation extremely seriously. If you are affected by or are aware of any incidents of this nature, speak to your manager as soon as possible. We will do all we can to stop this behaviour. As we take any allegations seriously, if a manager reviews the allegation and feels that it is a form of discrimination, bullying, harassment, sexual harassment or victimisation, they will automatically use the formal fair treatment process.
2. Confidentiality
So far as is possible we will only share information with people who are involved in resolving the complaint. If your complaint is about another colleague, we'll need to inform them so that we can help resolve the situation.
3. Supportive process
We encourage colleagues to raise any issues that are concerning them. You won‚Äôt get in trouble for doing this or for being a witness for someone else who has raised a complaint. We take it very seriously if anyone victimises a colleague for complaining or being a complaint witness and we may take disciplinary action against them.
4. Appropriate channel
Whilst the fair treatment process is in place to support dealing with complaints, there are other channels that may be more appropriate for the issue you are raising to make sure it is dealt with in the right way.
Appeals against disciplinary decisions, dismissals and redundancies must be dealt with via the appeal process as explained in the Disciplinary and Appeal policy.
Collective complaints raised by Trade Union or colleague representatives should be resolved through consultation or an agreed process. If a number of colleagues raise a complaint together, we might suggest that they elect one person to pursue the complaint on their behalf.
5. Genuine complaints
We expect that complaints are made in good faith, but if we find this is not the case, we will take it very seriously. An example of this is disingenuous complaints raised to divert attention from another issue e.g. a disciplinary investigation. Cases such as this could lead to disciplinary action.
6. Whistleblowing
Colleagues can report wrongdoing in confidence using RightLine which is an independent and audited service. The free phone number (0800 085 2099) and website are available for all colleagues, contractors and suppliers who work for us in any capacity. For more information on types of situations that would be considered wrong doing, please refer to the Reporting Wrongdoing - Whistleblowing Policy.
7. External advice
Any colleague who feels they are being bullied or harassed and would like confidential advice can call a free helpline for advice at any time. It‚Äôs run by an external company called Validium and is independent of the company. Freephone 0800 027 7777 or 0330 123 9653

Please clean up your environment. I felt the store looked jaded & the displays in the home & toy part were uninspiring. I am also always disappointed in the area outside the store. Dead trees in the car park, so much rubbish in the hedges surrounding the store. I thought this was a flagship store. It is in the middle of the national forest. I think Major UK Retailer can do better.
Can usually find everything I need but occasionally there will be stock shortages of specific products for which I have bonus nectar points or tailored nectar prices, often on last day of offer. This can be annoying but understandable.

     ‚Ä¢ Scene: The image depicts a close-up view of a dirty white metal shelf inside what appears to be a refrigerated storage unit or freezer. On the left side of the shelf, there are several vacuum-sealed packages of red meat stacked on top of each other. The shelf itself shows significant dirt or mold spots and stains, and there is a piece of torn, brownish-faded material or residue stuck near the front edge. The right side of the image shows a white handle attached to the refrigeration unit door, with some visible rust or brownish staining around the hinge area. Below the shelf and behind the door, more vacuum-sealed packages of red meat can be seen. The floor is white tiled with some dirt or stains visible.
