# Evidence Toolkit - Workflow Optimization Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Goal**: Optimize workflows without adding complexity
**Approach**: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

---

## Current State ✅

**Evidence Toolkit v3.0** is production-ready:
- 48 unified Pydantic models
- 9 CLI command groups
- Storage management commands
- Case management commands
- AI-powered analysis
- Complete documentation

**No code changes needed** - Project is solid!

## Workflow Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Custom Slash Commands (RECOMMENDED START)

**Create 2 simple slash commands** that solve real workflow pain points:

#### 1. `/investigate-evidence [sha256]`
**What it does**: Investigates evidence analysis failures
**Why**: Debugging requires reading multiple JSON files - automate this
**Value**: High - saves time on every debugging session
**Complexity**: Low - just a templated prompt with bash commands

#### 2. `/validate-case [case-id]`
**What it does**: Validates schema compliance for all evidence in a case
**Why**: Ensures legal admissibility before client delivery
**Value**: Medium - critical for quality assurance
**Complexity**: Low - runs existing commands in sequence

### Phase 2: Agents (ONLY IF NEEDED)

**After using slash commands for 1-2 weeks**, measure:
- Are slash commands solving 80%+ of cases?
- Do we need iterative debugging loops?
- Do we need automated validation with decision-making?

**If YES to any**, consider adding:
- `evidence-forensics-investigator` agent
- `schema-compliance-validator` agent

**If NO**, slash commands are sufficient!

## Why Start with Slash Commands?

1. **Simpler** - No agent overhead, just prompt templates
2. **Faster** - Can implement in <30 minutes each
3. **Measurable** - Easy to track usage and value
4. **Reversible** - Can upgrade to agents anytime
5. **KISS** - Follows "simplest solution first" principle
6. **Lower cost** - No separate context windows

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **Review** [AGENT_PROPOSAL.md](.claude/AGENT_PROPOSAL.md)
2. **Decide**: Start with slash commands or jump to agents?
3. **Create**: Whichever approach you choose

### If Starting with Slash Commands (Recommended)

```bash
# Create commands directory
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Create investigate-evidence command
# (See AGENT_PROPOSAL.md for template)

# Create validate-case command
# (See AGENT_PROPOSAL.md for template)

# Test them
/investigate-evidence 1102b318a5fe2fc6
/validate-case WORKPLACE-2024-003
```

### If Starting with Agents

```bash
# Use the /agents command
/agents

# Create new agent
# Follow the interactive prompts
# Use templates from AGENT_PROPOSAL.md
```

## Documentation Reference

**Anthropic's Guidance**:
- [docs/ai-docs/claude/build_effective_agents.md](../docs/ai-docs/claude/build_effective_agents.md)
- Read via: `~/.claude-code-docs/claude-docs-helper.sh sub-agents`
- Read via: `~/.claude-code-docs/claude-docs-helper.sh slash-commands`

**Key Insights from Anthropic**:
> "Success in the LLM space isn't about building the most sophisticated system.
> It's about building the right system for your needs. Start with simple prompts,
> optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems
> only when simpler solutions fall short."

## Decision Framework

Use this to decide slash command vs agent:

| Question | Slash Command | Agent |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Fixed workflow with predictable steps? | ✅ | |
| Need dynamic decision-making? | | ✅ |
| Need iterative loops? | | ✅ |
| Simple, repeatable task? | ✅ | |
| One-time execution? | ✅ | |
| Need to maintain state? | | ✅ |
| Budget conscious? | ✅ | |

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure value:

### For Slash Commands
- **Usage count**: How many times per week?
- **Success rate**: Did it solve the problem?
- **Time saved**: Minutes per usage
- **Satisfaction**: Does it make work easier?

### For Agents (if created)
- **Accuracy**: Root cause found correctly?
- **Efficiency**: Time to resolution
- **Reliability**: Consistent results?
- **Cost**: Token usage vs value delivered

## Recommendation

**START WITH SLASH COMMANDS**

Why? Because:
1. Evidence Toolkit is already solid (v3.0 complete)
2. No burning workflow problems that need agents
3. Slash commands provide 80% of value with 20% of complexity
4. Can always upgrade to agents later if needed
5. Follows KISS principle perfectly

**What to create first**:
- `/investigate-evidence` - Solves debugging pain
- `/validate-case` - Ensures quality

**When to revisit**:
- After 2 weeks of usage
- If slash commands prove insufficient
- If new workflow patterns emerge

**Remember**: The goal is to optimize workflows, not add complexity!
