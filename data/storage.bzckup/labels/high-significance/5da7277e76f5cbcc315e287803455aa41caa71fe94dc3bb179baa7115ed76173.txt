Hello Paul,
Thank you for your email.
We would like to support you the best we can to aid your return to work. Whilst, as I'm
sure you are aware, contacting the store in regards to absence is process, I am happy to
accept this e-mail as your contact at this time.
Just to confirm, are you requesting time off, or are you letting me know you will remain
absent via sick, until the process has been concluded? If you are looking to remain off as
sick, please remember regular contact and sick notes would be required in a timely
manner, as to not affect your pay. If, however, you are looking to take time that isn't sick,
please let me know and I can guide you through the process relating to this.
I will also attach policies for your reference to this email. If you need anything from me in
the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact me.
Kind regards
Amy Martin.

Subject: Short Leave - Wellbeing

Dear Amy
Given the ongoing strain caused by persistant, unresolved workplace issues over the past
6–12 months, I’m finding it increasingly difficult to maintain my usual rotine. Until the
process reaches a clear outcome, I’ve made the decision to take short leave in order to
protect my mental health and act responsibly.
I’ve also booked a GP appointment to discuss the impact this situation has had on me
and to ensure I’m doing what’s necessary to safeguard my wellbeing.
I will not be attending my scheduled shift tonight. I’ll review my ability to return for future
shifts based on how things progress and the outcome of the ongoing process.
Please treat this email as you would a call-in. At this time, I’m not comfortable using other
forms of communication with the store.
Thank you for your understanding,
Paul Boucherat
