Hi Paul,
As requested, I am planning to have someone in over the next 4 Sundays to clean aisle 1. Once this has been done then I will make
sure that the cleaning programme for Fresh foods is followed.
Please feel free to contact me at any time if you have any questions going forward.
Regards
Michael

Hi Rachel and Trish
Just checking you received my email with the attached letter? I've included Trish to this
follow up as I wasn't sure who was on rota.
Many Thanks
Paul

Dear Rachel,
I hope you're having a good day.
Following our one-to-one meeting on Friday (31st Jan) in the HR office, Sam and I have
put together a detailed letter regarding the ongoing food safety concerns we discussed.
I've linked it to this email.
I wanted to mention that while I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me on Friday,
I was a bit concerned about the formality of the meeting and specifically that notes were
taken and later 'passed on'. As someone with learning and neurodevelopmental
conditions, I find it particularly important to be able to be given time to read and review
any formal documentation, especially when it's being shared with others.
The letter provides a comprehensive overview of our concerns and suggested solutions.
While some parts may seem detailed, my neurodivergent perspective means I often
notice and track patterns that others might miss, which in this case I believe has helped
document these ongoing issues thoroughly.
I really hope we can work together constructively on addressing these concerns. Despite
the formal nature of the letter, our goal remains to find practical solutions that work for
everyone.
Would you be able to confirm receipt of this email and the linked letter?
Kind regards,
Paul
