Dear Paul,
Re: Confirmation of suspension
Following our conversation on 24/08/2025, I am writing to confirm the decision to suspend you on full pay from this date while the following allegations are being investigated:
Gross Misconduct case due to unreasonable behaviour and not picking items on shopping (NAG)
Your suspension allows an impartial and fair investigation to take place. I can assure you that this is not a form of disciplinary action, and no decision has been made ahead of the outcome. Your suspension will be kept under review, with the aim to keep this as brief as possible.
Please ensure you are available during normal working hours in case we need to contact you or meet with you. Whilst you are suspended from work you should not attend any of the Company's premises and you must not contact any customers, suppliers, or colleagues, except for your chosen colleague or Trade Union representative.
You can find further information about the relevant policies and procedures on OurSainsburys.co.uk.
In the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact me on 01283226792 or amy.martin1@sainsburys.co.uk
As a reminder, if this matter is impacting your personal wellbeing and you require independent and confidential advice or support, you can find information by searching Wellbeing on Our Sainsburys. Here you can find a number of support materials including information about how to access our Employee Assistance Programme.
Yours sincerely,
Amy Martin
