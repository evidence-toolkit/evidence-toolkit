I thin that when i raised concerns and escalate manamgment respond in negative ways. Its not that they abuse me or anything, but over the prolonged period
I do feel vicitimised, i do feel hurt and not listened to for raising serious concerns. 
I have not been aggressive or inimidating. No threats, only promises.  
I have autism, ADHD and dyslexia.
