I am writing to confirm the outcome of the Fair Treatment meeting held on 30/06/2025, to discuss the concerns you raised.
I have now completed my investigations and following a thorough review of all the information that was available to me I would now
like to take each point and explain my decision.
Your concerns were as follows:
A formal review of how the disclosure was managed by the store management team: You felt that your observations regarding the
cleaning standards in the fresh department were not addressed or taken seriously by your line managers. Despite raising your
concerns several times verbally, in writing, and by showing the cleaning to the online Customer Trading Managers (CTMS) in
person, you feel that the issue was not escalated for resolution. After several months of raising the issue, you brought it up again
on 31st January 2025 during a coaching session to discuss your items per hour (IPH). You then followed up with a formal email to
the online lead on 2nd February, highlighting your concerns. During our meeting, you expressed that the response you received
was inadequate, especially considering the extended period over which you had been raising these concerns.
My findings are: Following a thorough investigation, which included reviewing the evidence you provided, along with additional
information I gathered independently. I also assessed the actions taken during the period when your concerns were raised.
Based on this comprehensive review, it is my view that the line managers to whom you initially reported the issue did not respond
to or escalate the matter in a timely or effective manner.
Your concerns were valid, and it is clear there was a delay in both the response and escalation processes. The matter should have
been addressed at the point you first raised it.
Based on my findings I am upholding this point.
During our meeting, you expressed that this situation has taken a mental toll on you, leaving you feeling very stressed and
frustrated due to the seriousness of the issue. You mentioned feeling that you were being treated unfairly and were required to
complete a different picking process compared to your colleagues, simply to achieve an IPH figure, without addressing the root
problem. You feel that the IPH conversations followed you raising concerns around cleaning within the store.
Additionally, you shared that you have spent a considerable amount of time at home compiling evidence for the teams, which has
affected your home life.
You also highlighted that the nightshift manager approached you on your first day back after your holiday, and after you had sent
your formal complaint. This made you feel targeted for speaking up.
My finding are: After thoroughly reviewing all the evidence you presented, it is clear that you have invested a significant amount of
time in compiling your findings into a detailed and well-structured timeline. Your commitment to accuracy was evident during our
Registered in England & Wales. Company registration number: 03261722meeting, and I fully recognise the impact this situation has had on you.
I have also carefully examined the IPH process within the store. Throughout the investigation, I found no evidence to suggest that
you were treated differently during coaching conversations compared to your colleagues. However, I did note that no other
colleague is asked to skip items that require attention. This inconsistency is significant and will be addressed to ensure a fair and
consistent approach for all team members.
While there is no documented evidence of the conversation with the nightshift manager. It is my reasonable belief that the
interaction did occur. That conversation should have focused on resolving the situation, rather than questioning your actions in
taking photos.
Based on my findings I am partially upholding this point
During our meeting, you also expressed concerns about how colleagues may be treated if they raise similar issues or concerns in
the future
I understand how this has made you feel, and that’s not how we want any of our colleagues to feel.
At Sainsbury's, we take pride in listening to our team's concerns and upholding our company values. While we strive to get things
right, we acknowledge that there may be times when we fall short. It is important to us that all colleagues who raise safety or
operational issues are appropriately supported, and that their concerns are taken seriously and addressed promptly, without fear of
negative treatment or retaliation.
We strongly encourage all colleagues to raise any concerns they may have. Creating a culture where people feel safe and
supported in speaking up is a priority for us.
To support this, we have established clear procedures that allow colleagues to raise concerns confidentially. Wherever possible,
we encourage you to raise issues informally and promptly with your Line Manager. If further escalation is needed, you may speak
with the Deputy Manager or Store Manager.
If you remain dissatisfied with how your concern has been handled, you can contact the ER Support team via email for further
support.
I’ll be following this up with the store to make sure that any concerns raised by colleagues are addressed appropriately moving
forward and in line with our policy and values.
During our meeting you requested a formal opportunity to review and discuss the more serious photographic evidence, particularly
where there may be unresolved hygiene or health concerns.
I believe this has now been addressed. I have thoroughly reviewed your evidence and engaged with stakeholders within the
business to ensure all your concerns are addressed. I can confirm that the correct food safety processes are being followed, and
the store remains committed to adhering to all policies and procedures in line with food safety requirements.
After listening carefully to everything that you have said and having conducted my investigations, I have concluded that your
concerns should be upheld in some, but not all respects. As outlined in point one, I have upheld this because the line managers did
not escalate the matter in a timely or effective manner.
Regarding point two, I agree that you were given a different process to follow compared to your colleagues and were spoken to
inappropriately in front of your peers by a member of management. I understand how this experience has affected you while raising
your concerns, and I have upheld this point as well.
Regarding the concerns you raised about other colleagues and potential future issues—as these relate to actions that have not yet
occurred—I am unable to uphold or not uphold these points at this time. However, I would like to reiterate that we actively
encourage all colleagues to raise any concerns they may have. We take pride in listening to our team's feedback and upholding our
company values.
In relation to your request for a formal opportunity to review your concerns, I believe this has now been completed. Your concerns
have been recorded, and senior stakeholders within the business will continue to ensure that the store follows the correct cleaning
and food safety procedures.
Please find enclosed a copy of the notes taken at the meeting.
Thank you for bringing this to my attention and I am sorry that this has been your experience.
I hope you can appreciate that the concerns have been taken seriously and I have conducted a fair and thorough investigation into
all of the points raised.
I do hope that this resolves the situation, and I am grateful for your patience during my investigations.
