Supporting Statement: Disciplinary Hearing of Paul Boucherat
Submitted by Samantha Samantha

I am writing this statement in support of my husband, Paul [Surname], in relation to the current disciplinary proceedings.

Paul has consistently raised legitimate health and safety concerns within the workplace. These matters are not trivial: they are directly connected to the wellbeing of both staff and customers, and fall under statutory duties of care. Raising such concerns is a protected disclosure under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. Employees must never be penalised for fulfilling this responsibility. To discipline Paul for raising such issues amounts to retaliation against a whistleblower, which is unlawful.

It is also important to note that during Paul’s sickness absence, he continued to engage with the workplace through the formal investigation into the store’s hygiene standards. This process was overseen by an external manager, who upheld Paul’s complaint. The external manager was sufficiently concerned to immediately install a cleaning station and required the store to implement further corrective actions. This independent validation demonstrates that Paul’s concerns were both justified and serious, and that he followed the correct process step by step.

Despite this, the incidents now being used against Paul all occurred around the time of, or after, this upheld outcome. Yet no meaningful training or responsibilities were put in place following the investigation. Instead of receiving the support and adjustments he was entitled to, Paul was met with disciplinary action. This sequence strongly suggests retaliation, rather than a fair or reasonable response.

It is also essential to recognise that Paul is neurodivergent. He has formal diagnoses of Dyslexia and ADHD, with a confirmed high likelihood of Autism (commonly referred to as AuDHD). This neurodivergence directly shapes his communication style and responses to workplace stress. Key characteristics include:

    Directness and clarity of speech, with less reliance on social “softening” language.

    A strong sense of justice and urgency, particularly around issues of safety and fairness.

    Heightened emotional intensity when concerns are repeatedly dismissed or ignored.

What may be perceived by others as “aggression” is, in reality, the expression of passion, integrity, and a disability-related communication difference. Under the Equality Act 2010, this must be recognised. Employers have a duty to make reasonable adjustments, including ensuring managers understand these communication differences and can distinguish between passionate advocacy and genuine misconduct.

Paul’s stress-related sickness absence was a direct result of unresolved workplace issues. On his return, instead of being supported, he was immediately met with disciplinary action. This approach risks being both discriminatory under the Equality Act 2010 and unlawful in the context of whistleblowing protections. The law is clear: treating a disabled employee unfavourably because of something arising from their disability, or victimising them for making protected disclosures, is prohibited.

There is also evidence of inconsistency in how standards are applied. Other staff members have raised their voices loudly in front of colleagues and customers, with no action taken against them. Yet Paul has been singled out following his protected disclosures and despite his openness about his disability. This demonstrates double standards and strengthens the case that he is being unfairly treated and victimised.

I respectfully ask that the panel carefully consider:

    The protected nature of the disclosures Paul has made.

    The independent validation of his concerns by an external manager.

    The role of his neurodivergence in shaping his communication style.

    The employer’s duty to make reasonable adjustments, including training managers to better understand disability-related differences.

Paul’s motivation has always been to protect, not to harm. He has acted out of concern for safety, fairness, and compliance with workplace standards. To discipline him for these actions would not only be unjust, but could also amount to disability discrimination and unlawful victimisation under whistleblowing protections.

Respectfully submitted,
Samantha Boucherat
