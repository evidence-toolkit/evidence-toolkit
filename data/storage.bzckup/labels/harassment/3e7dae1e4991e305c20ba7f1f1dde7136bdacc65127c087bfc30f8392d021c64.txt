During our outcome meeting I asked if you would like a conciliation meeting with the
managers involved in the store . If you wish this to happen could let me know and I will
arrange. I know you are currently away from the business at the moment this can be

Hi Paul,
To confirm receipt of the this email and that the link works to the evidence - the timeline is
really helpful.
I have all the evidence I need at the moment to continue with my investigation and thank
you for confirming about the different picking process, I have got that information too.
If I require any more information I will contact you via email.
Kind regards
Rob

Hi Rob,
Due to commitments and time constraints, it was more convenient to host and provide the
link immediately. Additionally, considering annual leave, distances and the nature of the
evidence this seemed the logical solution. It also means any new issues can be
documented easily and with transparency.
https://swad-live-repo.netlify.app/
As discussed, there are several things included. A H&S Concern, retaliations, breaches of
policies. Fair treatment concerns regarding speaking up and raising issues, as well as
how each escalation was handled.
I now provide:
- Timeline from March 2024 - June 2025
- Full gallery of all images, key photos load at the top. Select a month to filter by
month.
- Fair treatment complaint - A more personal account, I was asked how these
things made me feel in our Monday meeting, I tried to answer that more specifically
this time.
I will wrap password access around it shortly and update you.
Regarding your question;
Yes, to my knowledge the only shopper. Samantha certainly didn't get this instruction. I
can go into more details but the interaction with Amy and Michael in early March is on the
fair treatment page, it's a good starting point, this is backed with an email and happened
after I was brought in to the office multiple times. Any further questions, and with that
context acknowledged, ill be happy to answer.
Regards
Paul

Good Afternoon Paul,
Thank you for taking the time to email me and share your further concerns:
In regards to the investigation while I am on holiday. Due to the nature and complexity of
the case I feel it would not be beneficial to the investigation to hand this over for a week. If
you are happy for me to share an brief overview with my Deputy store manager , He can
be a point of reference for you if there are any further developments you wish to share ,
then I am more than happy to do this and share his details with you.
I do have a further question after your email , you stated that you have been assigned a
different picking process to your peers. Can you share the detail of the difference and to
your knowledge are you the only person assigned a different picking process?
To summarise actions from the Fair Treatment meeting :
I have attached the notes from the meeting and a copy of the fair treatment policy.
You kindly were going to provide a copy of your timeline of events and Provide a copy of
Photos of evidence.
As discussed I know you are on holiday this week and want to thank you for spending the
time to share the information I require.

Regards
Rob

Subject: Follow-up on Monday’s Meeting – Fair Treatment & H&S Concerns
Hi Rob,
Thank you again for taking the time to meet with me on Monday morning. I wanted to
provide a brief update and raise a couple of follow-up requests.
For context, our discussion lasted over two hours. About halfway through, I believe we
reached a shared understanding of the true nature and scale of my fair treatment
complaint, largely due to how the language and timeline were interpreted.
To clarify:
• This is not a complaint that began a few weeks ago. It concerns an ongoing issue
spanning 12+ months, underpinned by formal evidence of health and safety failures
that were repeatedly ignored, now not just locally at Swadlincote.
• The fair treatment and health & safety complaints are intertwined; one cannot
be properly understood without the context of the other.
• Despite my June escalation to the Safety & Insurance team, nothing materially
changed. I was given the same reassurances I received back in March. While
surface-level improvements are visible, they do not address the underlying systemic
issues or the store’s actual cleanliness.
I shared how unsafe and unsuitable the store environment has been for months,
particularly around chilled and ready-to-eat food. I believe we are placing colleagues,
contractors, and customers at ongoing risk, especially online recipients who cannot
inspect products themselves. Colleagues are repeatedly exposed to these conditions
shift after shift and often carry that exposure into ambient areas of the store.
Combined with the pressure created by performance metrics, this leaves staff facing
an impossible choice between upholding health and safety or meeting targets. I
raised concerns about the stores reliability of audits, policies and processes such as
historic cleaning records and risk assessments, which often do not reflect the
conditions we actually work in.
As discussed, here’s why I wrote my February letter:
• The escalating pressure I experienced, both before and after raising the issue
formally.
• Multiple internal escalation attempts made in good faith, aimed at keeping the
matter internal.
• The lack of support, despite me taking on additional workload from a sense of duty
around safety and standards. (See meeting notes Jan. 28 (RH - online), prior to Feb
letter)
You asked how all of this has made me feel. I described the sustained impact:
frustration, exhaustion, and the toll it’s taken on both my personal and professional
relationships. I also raised serious concerns about how I’ve been treated since:
• Targeted over my IPH metrics while legitimate concerns were ignored.
• Assigned a different picking process to my peers.
• Gaslit, singled out, and made to feel responsible for failings.
Many of these actions took place after I submitted my letter.
As we agreed, this is just the surface. The case is large, complex, and backed by
well-organised evidence. While I truly appreciated the time you gave me, I’m
conscious that not every stakeholder will be able to dedicate two hours to reach the
same level of understanding.
To help with this, I’m working to restructure the core materials into a standalone
reference. This has been slowed slightly as I’m currently on annual leave, I still aim
to share the updated file by end of day today but it's likely to slip into tomorrow.
In the meantime, I’d encourage you to review the SharePoint drive I’ve already
shared with store management and the Food Safety team. At our meeting and for full
transparency I stated concerns that several other key internal stakeholders had
seemingly been shared access to that SharePoint drive, which contains:
• My February formal letter
• Chronological photo archive
• A number Email records
• Personal information
• Clear documentation of concerns
I’m also setting up a live evidence repository to capture future developments.
You’ll receive password-protected access to this next week.
Since I was unable to record our meeting, could you please share a copy of the
notes taken by Lisa? Once received, I’ll review, sign, and return an agreed copy for
your records.
One final point: if you are due to take annual leave at the end of the week, I’d appreciate
clarity on who will be my point of contact in your absence, and who (if anyone) will be
responsible for progressing the investigation during that period. Given the seriousness
and time-sensitive nature of the concerns raised, it would be reassuring to understand
how continuity is being managed internally.
Thanks again for your time. I appreciate the seriousness with which you’re treating this
matter.
Best regards,
Paul Boucherat
