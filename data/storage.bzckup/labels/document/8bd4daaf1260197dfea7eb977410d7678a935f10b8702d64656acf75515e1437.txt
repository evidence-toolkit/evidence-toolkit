Hi Nick,
Thanks for consulting with ER and for informing me of the Fair Treatment referral.
This wasn’t something I expected to raise when I started working here. Working 16 hours a week in a store open 15 hours a day and
this many images highlights how many internal and external standards may be falling through the cracks. Given the time and attention
now involved, I hope this can be resolved swiftly and constructively.
I do have some initial questions that relate to both health and safety, and food safety;
--Based on the images submitted, are colleagues on the shop floor properly trained and equipped, including PPE, to manage this level
of decontamination safely?
--Was ER or Group Safety and Insurance already aware of any of these concerns prior to my escalation?
--How frequently are internal audits conducted at this store and were these issues raised in previous ones?
--Has the site undergone any risk assessment specifically related to contamination, pathogens, or pest control?
--Are any of the hazards documented in my report legally reportable (e.g., RIDDOR)?
--What’s the protocol when contamination is discovered? Are there escalation paths, and were they followed here?
It’s hard to see the volume of blood, biological growth, and debris in those photos without asking whether these conditions could be
contributing to illness. Many of the potential health risks are serious enough to disrupt work, personal commitments, or medical care for
staff, contractors, or customers.
The website makes this accessible to internal teams, regulators, or external stakeholders with an interest in food safety. I’ll be updating
as required.
The store appears to be aware of the escalation. I was approached by a manager and questioned. Cleanliness has improved in the past
few days. I obviously want the store clean, but the timing reinforces the point: my message hasn’t changed, what’s changed is who’s
watching.
I look forward to the findings from your visit and to maintaining momentum toward a resolution that works for everyone.
Best regards,
Paul Boucherat

Good morning, Paul,
Thank you for your email and link. I spoke with an ER specialist this morning and addressed the points you raised during our call on Tuesday, June
17th, regarding your treatment when raising health and safety issues to the management team. I also addressed the concern you mentioned in last
night’s email about the independence of the regional investigation.
The ER specialist advised that you raise a fair treatment case regarding the store team's treatment of you when you raised your concerns. I have
attached the fair treatment policy for your reference.
Please send your complaint to ER: - ER.support@sainsburys.co.uk and cc to ER.executives@sainsburys.co.uk.
As I mentioned during our call on Tuesday, June 17th, I will make an unannounced visit to the store to evaluate and record my findings on the issues
you've raised, the controls in place, and the ongoing adherence to Health and Safety standards and procedures. If you have continued concerns
about health and safety or food safety, please let me know.
Many Thanks

Dear Nick and Harriet,
Following Nick’s call on Tuesday evening (17 June), I’ve taken the step of creating a visual summary of my food safety disclosure to
support clearer and more accessible review.
As explained during our conversation, I’ve been documenting hygiene and contamination issues at Sainsbury’s Swadlincote over a 15-
month period. The evidence folder you’ve already seen contains over 500 timestamped photographs, customer impact data, and a
detailed timeline of management responses.
Given the seriousness of the issues and with no update received regarding the investigation into store management, less than 24 hours
before my next shift, I’ve built this structured visual format to support proper escalation:
[https://hr-evidence-site.vercel.app/]
Why I'm sending this now
• On Sunday 15 June, a manager approached me referencing my escalation to Paul Gant. This confirms that the concerns I raised
have been passed back down the chain of command.
• That undermines the independence of any regional-led investigation and places me in a difficult position ahead of my next shift
(04:00 Thursday).
What the site includes
• Key incidents: The Fallen Prawn, Orange Fish, Mould near ready-to-eat products
• Systemic timeline: Discovery → Management Response → Corporate Escalation
• IPH vs. Safety: Productivity targets actively discourage safety compliance
• Clearly not dealt with as recently as June 2025
This has been prepared in good faith, with the aim of protecting customers, colleagues, and the organisation by ensuring a fair and
credible process.
Please confirm next steps and who will now take ownership of this matter.
Kind regards,
Paul Boucherat

Hi Nick,
18:30 works perfectly. I haven't used TEAMS much but I'm sure it will be fine. I can share relevant documentation from our SharePoint
if that would be helpful during our discussion.
One quick request - could you arrange for IT to grant me additional storage access? The comprehensive documentation I've compiled is
quite extensive and I've hit my current storage limits.
Thanks for making time for this important conversation.
Best regards,
Paul

Hi Paul,
Thank you for getting back to me.
Would you be free at 18:30? I am staying in a hotel so will be around to discuss the issues you have raised. I can do TEAMS if this
works for you.
Thanks
Nick

Hi Nick,
Thank you for your prompt response and for taking this matter seriously.
I'm available for a call on Tuesday evening. Please let me know what time works best for you and whether you'll call me directly or if
you'd prefer Teams/other platform.
To ensure our discussion is productive, I've prepared documentation including:
- A chronological timeline of events (March 2024 - present)
- Key evidence demonstrating systematic failures
- Specific breaches of Sainsbury's Food Safety Code
- The five resolutions requested in February that remain unaddressed
Given the extensive time I've invested documenting these safety concerns over 12+ months, I'd appreciate confirmation that this work is
recognised as a protected disclosure under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, and clarity on how my time will be acknowledged.
I look forward to our discussion and to establishing a clear action plan with concrete timelines.
Best regards,
Paul Boucherat

Hi Paul,
I hope you are well. I have been advised of the H&S matters you raised at the Swadlincote store and have reviewed the ﬁle you kindly
sent. I would like to schedule a call with you next week to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation. While your information
is detailed, some discussions would be beneﬁcial before proceeding to the next stage.
I assure you that I am taking this matter very seriously and will take steps to resolve it and maintain momentum. Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.
Are you available on Tuesday evening?
Best regards,
Nick
