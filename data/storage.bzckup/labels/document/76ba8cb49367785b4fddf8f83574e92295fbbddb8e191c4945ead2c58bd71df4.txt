Dear ER Team,
I am raising a Fair Treatment complaint following advice from Nick Ringrose, Operational
Field Safety Manager, after he consulted with an ER specialist. This relates to how I was
treated after raising serious food safety concerns at the Swadlincote store.
In February 2025, Samantha Boucherat and I co-submitted a formal H&S concern to the
line manager, highlighting persistent hygiene and contamination issues in the chilled
section. Despite providing this and following internal escalation routes, the concerns were
initially dismissed or downplayed by local store management. It took several months,
multiple follow-ups, and considerable personal effort to have the matter taken seriously.
Throughout this process, I felt I was not listened to, was made to feel responsible for
solving the issue alone, and experienced avoidance and deflection rather than support.
This created unnecessary stress and pressure, particularly as a part-time colleague
acting in good faith to raise a genuine health and safety risk.
Given that this concern was raised in good faith and likely meets the criteria of a
protected disclosure, I believe there has been a failure to uphold fair treatment and duty
of care.
Accordingly, I am requesting:
1. A formal review of how the disclosure was handled by store management.
2. Acknowledgement of the impact this has had on me, both personally and in terms of
work.
3. Clarity on how similar concerns will be handled going forward to ensure colleagues
raising safety issues are appropriately supported.
4. A formal opportunity to review and discuss the more serious photographic evidence,
particularly where there may be unresolved hygiene or health concerns.
I am happy to provide a full timeline, evidence, or any clarification you require.
