Hi Deborah,
Thanks for your letter dated 26/08 inviting me to an investigation meeting.
As discussed on the phone, please confirm the postponement to Wednesday 03/09/2025
at 10:00 in order to review and organise a companion.
To answer your points properly, please share the following before the meeting:
A) “Failing to pick 30 items” on 23/08/25
• The itemised list of the 30 items (SKU/description).
• Any handset reason codes/notes recorded against those items (e.g., poor quality,
unavailable).
• My handset logs for Thu 21 → Sun 24 Aug showing:
• Poor Quality presses
• Call Supervisor activations
• any NAG/not-picked entries (and any item links).
• Any relevant cleaning logs/work orders and risk assessments for the areas
those items came from during Thu 21 → Sun 24 Aug.
• The same cleaning logs / work orders / risk assessments for the period Aug
2024 → Aug 2025 (HACCP-related controls, deep-clean schedules, sign-off).
• A copy of any current guidance that defines Poor Quality / NAG / not-picked, and
when colleagues should use Poor Quality and Call Supervisor
• The tote-cleaning SOP/guidelines and any records relating to tote cleaning for
the periods above.
B) “Inappropriate behaviour” on 17/08/25
• The exact time and location, the words alleged, and names of any
witnesses with their notes.
• If you intend to rely on CCTV, please confirm and share the footage; if not, please
preserve any relevant CCTV for that date/time window.
C) Context documents
• Any instruction and/or risk assessment relating to the “skip the item → find a
manager → return later” / “communicate with management as agreed” process I
was told to follow.
• Any response or report arising from my early-February 2025 H&S concern email
(which was later escalated and provided to Ryan Allen (Store manager / Regional
Safety Champion) and Michael Kicks (Deputy Store manager) in early March).
• I confirm receipt of the 24/08 notes that accompanied your invite; please let me
know if there are any further notes or statements you plan to use.
D) Preservation
• Please preserve relevant CCTV for 17/08 and for 21–24/08 in the areas linked to
the 30 items and the tote-cleaning areas.
• Please also preserve CCTV for chilled aisles 1–4 for the standard retention period
and secure any clips identified as relevant for the duration of the investigation/
proceeding
• Please preserve the cleaning records, risk assessments, and my device
logs listed above.
Finally, during my shift on 23/08, I verbally requested access to the store’s cleaning
records. My manager, Amy acknowledged this and, as I understand it, raised it with
Michael Kicks; however, I did not receive a follow-up. Please confirm whether that request
was recorded or escalated, and share any note or record of it. I mention this here to
highlgiht the timing of my suspension, less that 24 hours later.
Kind regards,
Paul Boucherat
