Subject: Formal Complaint - Harassment

Hi HR,

I'm writing to formally complain about the harassment I've experienced from my manager.
Over the past 3 months, Sarah has made multiple inappropriate comments about my work performance.

Bob mentioned these issues to Paul last week, but nothing changed.

Regards,
Bob
