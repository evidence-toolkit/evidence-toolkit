Good Afternoon Paul,
Thank you for highlighting your concerns. I take this matter seriously and will reach out to Ryan Allen to arrange a visit to the store as
soon as possible.
In the meantime, please let me know if there is anything else I need to be aware of.
Kind regards,
Paul

Subject: Escalation: Ongoing Food Safety Breach – Swadlincote Store
Dear Paul and David,
I am writing to escalate an unresolved health and food safety issue at the Swadlincote store, which has persisted for over four months
despite formal internal reporting and discussions with local management.
Attached is the original report I submitted in February 2025 outlining serious hygiene concerns in the chilled section, including recurring
contamination, blood residue, and visible mould growth. Although assurances were given that a cleaning schedule would be
implemented, conditions remain largely unchanged. I’ve included updated photo evidence from April and June 2025 showing continued
debris, mould, and inadequate cleaning practices.
As an online assistant responsible for handling both chilled and ambient foods in succession, I’m concerned this poses an ongoing risk
to customers, particularly those relying on online deliveries who cannot inspect items in person. Given the length and visibility of this
issue, it now reﬂects a failure in both hygiene standards and basic operational management.
Due to system limits, I’ve uploaded the report and supporting ﬁles via the links below. Please let me know if there are access issues or if
alternate formats are preferred - I can resend or compress files if needed.
Please note: I’ve not copied in store-level management at this stage but am happy to do so if needed for clarity or coordination. I’m
raising this in good faith as someone who cares about standards, but as a part-time, GOL colleague, I’m not in a position to lead or
support the operational follow-up. I trust this will be addressed through the appropriate management channels.
Thank you for your time. I look forward to a formal response.
Kind regards,
Paul Boucherat
