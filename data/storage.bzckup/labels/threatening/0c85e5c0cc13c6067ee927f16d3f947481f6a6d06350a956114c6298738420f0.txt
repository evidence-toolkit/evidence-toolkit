Subject: Urgent Health & Safety Concern – Aisle 1 (Meat Section) 03/02/25  
 
Dear Management Team, 
 
We hope you are well. We are writing to formally follow up on ongoing concerns regarding 
the hygiene standards in Aisle 1 (Meat Section). Over the past 11 months, we have 
reported issues such as dried blood, food debris, and contamination on shelves used for 
storing raw meat and fish. Despite multiple notifications, the condition of this area appears to 
remain below acceptable levels. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Background & Context 
 
- We first spoke to line managers in March 2024, having reported poor quality on mince that 
was soiled, (which was photographed for when questioned). We have since raised the same 
issue on several occasions (July, October, December, January). 
 
- We have approached multiple managers about this matter, including one who stated it was 
"above his pay grade."  
 
- Following this interaction, we received verbal approval from our manager to use the "Poor 
Quality" function on our handheld devices in Aisle 1. Management agreed this would 
escalate the issue to the oversight team (GOL) and prompt faster remedial action. They also 
acknowledged that, "Unfortunately, this is the only way to get the action it needs." 
 
- On 23rd Jan 2025, we shared photos of the contamination in the "shoppers" WhatsApp 
group (which includes managers). We were told the issue would be addressed, but the 
shelves remain visibly dirty to this day. While some cleaning has occurred, the underlying 
issues remain unresolved, as evidenced by the persistent stains and debris. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Recent Developments: 
 
- On 31 January, I (Paul) used the poor quality button as a way to decline to pick any items 
from the visibly contaminated aisle, out of concern for our own safety and that of our 
customers, many of whom rely solely on online shopping and do not physically inspect the 
shelves. 
 
- Despite full awareness of the situation, management called me into a meeting in the HR 
office. Although the meeting was presented as "non-disciplinary," it felt like a precursor to 
formal action. At its conclusion, I was asked to clean the shelves alone. While I offered to 
help as part of a broader solution, I stressed that this is a systemic issue—not one that can 
be resolved by a single cleaning effort, by one member of staff. 
 
- When Samantha inquired about what was being done regarding the blood on the shelves, 
she was told, "Nothing, it's the packaging." This response suggests that the issue is known 
but is not being taken seriously at a senior level. 
 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Why This Matters 
 
Food Safety & Public Health: 
- Dried blood, raw meat, and fish juices can harbor harmful bacteria (e.g., Salmonella, E. 
coli, Listeria). Continued contamination endangers both customers and staff. 
 
- For instance, Sam’s own mother–along with several elderly neighbours—shop or rely on 
online deliveries here. It's especially concerning if those who are most vulnerable are 
unknowingly receiving items stored on unsanitary shelves. 
 
- Departmental targets seem to prioritize speed over hygiene and safety. For instance, online 
pickers have very limited time to wash their hands or clean equipment during their shifts, and 
a 'no log-out' policy exacerbates this issue. Without clear expectations for handwashing and 
personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, bacteria may spread across products, surfaces, 
trolleys, and handsets—and eventually, to other areas of the store or even the homes of 
colleagues and customers. 
 
Operational & Reputational Impact: 
- Based on previous experience in operations and product control roles, we know that such 
issues should be promptly addressed to protect both public health and the company's 
reputation. 
 
-Allowing food to be stored and handled in these conditions undermines customer trust 
and puts the store’s reputation at risk. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Resolutions 
 
Given the severity of the issue, we respectfully request the following be considered: 
 
1. Immediate Deep Clean: 
   - Conduct a thorough deep cleaning and sanitizing of all affected shelves, including proper 
disposal of any contaminated packaging. Follow this with a formal inspection to confirm that 
all contamination has been removed. 
 
2. Preventive Measures: 
   - Establish a formal cleaning schedule and accountability system to ensure hygiene 
standards are consistently maintained. 
   - If store policy is for staff to address these issues directly, please confirm what cleaning 
materials, protective equipment, and formal training will be provided to ensure safe and 
effective cleaning is done without risk to employees. 
 
3. Staff Training: 
   - Provide refresher training on handling raw meat and fish spills. Emphasize proper 
handwashing, the use of PPE (if available). 
 
 
 
 
4. Process & Audit: 
   - Investigate why hygiene concerns in Aisle 1 have persisted for 11 months despite 
multiple reports. Additionally, clarify how the store recently passed a 100% safety audit. A 
review is essential to ensure that future audits accurately reflect on-the-ground safety issues. 
    
   Note: During a December 'morning huddle', the team were congratulated on the store 
achieving a 100% safety audit. Several colleagues found this contradictory and raised the 
serious hygiene issues in Aisle 1. Clarifying how these issues could persist alongside a 
perfect audit score is critical for improving internal processes and ensuring that our safety 
standards are genuine—both on paper and in practice. 
 
5. Clear Communication: 
   - Provide a transparent update detailing the steps that will be taken to restore hygiene 
standards and ensure customer safety. 
 
We would appreciate a written response within 5 working days outlining the actions 
management intends to take to ensure that meat and fish shelves remain safe for both 
employees and customers. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Next Steps 
 
While we are aware of the internal whistleblowing system, our preference is to resolve this 
matter constructively and internally. Should no meaningful action be taken, we may be 
forced to escalate the issue to external authorities (e.g., Environmental Health, HSE, FSA). 
 
The fact we felt compelled to compose this letter during our scheduled time off and holiday 
reflects the urgency we feel about addressing these safety standards. We have attached 
multiple photographs showing dried blood and debris that have persisted for weeks and 
possibly months. I am happy to provide further images upon request. 
 
We do not take pleasure in raising these concerns; however, we firmly believe that our 
customers and colleagues deserve a safe and clean environment. Thank you for your time, 
and we look forward to a constructive and timely response. 
 
Kind regards,
