Having previously worked in Sainsburyâ€™s and shopped there for nearly 10 years, it is
disappointing that I feel I can no longer shop there. In recent months I have come across
shelves that are not always presented clean and I have seen aged mold/dirt, especially in
the fresh aisles and also have experience out of date produce that I have passed to staff that
I know.
Added to this being the mother-in-law of Paul Boucherat, I would like to add my support
into what he has provided evidence of in the way of cleanliness in the shop and the effect it
has having on his mental state and his marriage.
I have not seen Paul for many months now and he normally would join myself and
Samantha on a walk. On top of this this it has had effect on their marriage, putting un
necessary strain on their daily lives. As a result, I have not seen Samantha as much as
normal as she feels she needs to be home supporting Paul.
I understand that companies deal with situations in different ways, but understanding
mental health, autism and ADHD take experience and full understanding of the person in
question.
