Subject: Fitness for work note
Dear Ryan / Amy,
Please find attached a note from my GP covering sick leave from 18 July to 31 July 2025
due to work-related stress.
I’ll stay in touch and review my situation with my GP towards the end of this period. In the
meantime, please let me know if there’s any additional information or HR process I need
to complete.
Kind regards,
Paul
