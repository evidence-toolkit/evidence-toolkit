Good afternoon Paul,
Thank you for our chat this morning. It was good to have a walk around and see the impacted areas you have highlighted.
As requested, I have attached your original email that you sent to us.
Re the need for you or any shopper to go was their hands when shopping, I have no issue with this. If you are approached on the day,
re your IPH and you have been to wash your hands just inform us when/If we speak to you and there will not be an issue. We don't
know the shopper's reasons for a lower IPH before we approach them for a quick discussion about it, this is so we have a better
understanding if you need any assistance or there has been an impact to whilst shopping, for example, spillage, items being blocked by
shift stock, handset malfunction or handwashing. I hope that clears it up a little for you.
We spoke about fridge cleans this morning, the last fridge clean was in fact September last year and it is held annually, I was mistaken
this morning when we spoke.
I have also attached the cleaning schedule for the meat aisle, the aisle is set to be deep cleaned by colleagues through the period, after
which time it resets. The completion dates are next to the ticks.
Kind regards
Amy Martin.

Subject: Re: IPH Meeting
Good morning Amy,
Thank you for the meeting notes and follow-up.
Please attach my original February 2nd letter - with photos - regarding food safety concerns to these meeting notes, (mentioned
in the meeting) as it provides essential context for our discussion.
I appreciate Michael's email (March 5th) about the upcoming Sunday cleaning plan for Aisle 1.
To clarify the timeline:
- Feb 2: Submitted food safety concerns letter
- Feb 9: Attended 4:00 AM meeting about photography (my ﬁrst shift back from scheduled holiday)
- Feb 20: Requested proper cleaning equipment (received ice scraper)
- Mar 5: Received Sunday cleaning plan email
- Mar 6: Meeting about IPH metrics (which I was asked to attend after my shift ended at 8:00 AM)
I'm concerned yesterday's meeting shifted focus from serious food safety concerns to my personal productivity metrics. This creates a
fundamental problem within our department.
The solution provided ("you will skip an item... communicate with a manager... come back to pick the item") inappropriately centres the
responsibility on me as an individual rather than addressing the systemic issues that aﬀect all colleagues and customers.
Additionally, the current system creates an impossible conﬂict between maintaining food safety and meeting productivity targets for
any employee, not just me:
- Identifying safety issues takes time, aﬀecting IPH
- Reporting issues to management takes time, aﬀecting IPH
- Following safety procedures takes time, aﬀecting IPH
- Having meetings about these issues outside shift hours impacts personal time
This is not simply about individual performance but about:
- Legal food safety requirements for retail establishments
- Customer safety and public health
- Company reputation and brand protection
- Proper working conditions for all colleagues
My initial letter highlighted several unresolved systemic issues:
- Staﬀ training deﬁciencies
- Inadequate cleaning supplies and equipment
- Lack of proper documentation procedures
- Disconnect between perfect safety audit scores and actual conditions
Any eﬀective solution needs to address these underlying departmental problems rather than creating workarounds for
individual employees.
The current approach doesn't resolve the core conﬂict between safety requirements and productivity expectations that aﬀects our entire
team.
I'm committed to both safety standards and performance goals, but our systems should support both simultaneously rather than forcing
employees to prioritise one over the other.
Could we please schedule a follow-up meeting during regular work hours to discuss a more comprehensive approach?
Regards,
Paul

Good morning Paul,
Following our conversation this morning, I have attached the meeting notes to this email.
Going forward to help with your IPH we have agreed you will skip an item on the meat aisle that needs cleaning, you will then
communicate with a manager the issue you have found for it to be rectified, you will then come back to pick the item.
Kind Regards
Amy Martin.
