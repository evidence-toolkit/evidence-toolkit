## Evidence Toolkit Analysis Process

### 1. Evidence Ingestion
- Content-addressed storage using SHA256 hashing
- Metadata extraction and preservation
- Chain of custody initialization

### 2. Individual Evidence Analysis
- **Documents**: Text analysis, word frequency, concept extraction
- **Images**: AI-powered scene analysis, OCR, object detection
- **Emails**: Thread reconstruction, sentiment analysis, escalation detection

### 3. Cross-Evidence Correlation
- Entity extraction and matching across evidence types
- Timeline reconstruction from metadata and content
- Pattern detection and relationship analysis

### 4. AI-Powered Insights
- OpenAI Responses API with deterministic settings (temperature=0)
- Legal significance assessment
- Risk evaluation and compliance checking
- Professional recommendations generation

### 5. Quality Assurance
- Schema validation for all structured outputs
- Confidence scoring for all analysis results
- Complete audit trail maintenance
- Professional report generation
