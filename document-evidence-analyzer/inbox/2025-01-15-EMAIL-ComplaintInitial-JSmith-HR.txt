Subject: Formal Complaint - Workplace Harassment

Dear HR Team,

I am writing to formally report ongoing harassment and discriminatory behavior that I have experienced in the workplace. This complaint is submitted under company policy Section 4.2 regarding workplace conduct violations.

INCIDENT DETAILS:

Date: January 10, 2025
Time: Approximately 2:30 PM
Location: Conference Room B
Witnesses: Michael Johnson, Sarah Wilson

During the quarterly team meeting, my direct supervisor, Robert Davis, made inappropriate comments regarding my capabilities and questioned my technical competence in front of the entire team. He stated: "Maybe someone with more experience should handle the client presentation" and "This project might be too complex for certain team members."

These comments were directed at me specifically and occurred immediately after I volunteered to lead the upcoming client presentation. Similar incidents have occurred on multiple occasions since December 2024.

PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR:

- Exclusion from important meetings without notification
- Assignment of menial tasks despite my qualifications
- Public questioning of my professional abilities
- Denial of opportunities for advancement or skill development
- Creating a hostile work environment that affects my ability to perform my duties

IMPACT:

These actions have significantly impacted my work performance, professional development, and mental well-being. I have documented each incident with dates, times, and witnesses where applicable.

REQUEST FOR ACTION:

I request that HR conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and take appropriate corrective action to ensure a safe and respectful work environment. I am available to discuss this matter further and provide additional documentation as needed.

Please confirm receipt of this complaint and provide information regarding the investigation process and timeline.

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter.

Sincerely,
Jane Smith
