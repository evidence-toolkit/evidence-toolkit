## Timeline Quality Analysis

**IMPORTANT**: Timeline quality is measured by coherence and completeness, not just event count.

| Metric | Package A | Package B | Analysis |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Timeline Events | 25 | 41 | +16 events |
| Temporal Sequences | 9 | 5 | ‚úÖ Better (larger clusters) |
| Timeline Gaps | 6 | 3 | ‚úÖ Better (fewer gaps) |
| Avg Events/Sequence | 2.8 | 8.2 | ‚úÖ Better coherence |

### Timeline Gaps Breakdown

**Package A Gaps**:
- **9 days** (2024-09-01 ‚Üí 2024-09-10) - low significance
- **145 days** (2024-09-10 ‚Üí 2025-02-02) - high significance
- **25 days** (2025-02-08 ‚Üí 2025-03-05) - medium significance
- **13 days** (2025-03-09 ‚Üí 2025-03-22) - low significance
- **133 days** (2025-03-22 ‚Üí 2025-08-02) - high significance
- **15 days** (2025-08-02 ‚Üí 2025-08-17) - medium significance

**Package B Gaps**:
- **166 days** (2025-02-02 ‚Üí 2025-07-18) - high significance
- **13 days** (2025-07-18 ‚Üí 2025-07-31) - low significance
- **48 days** (2025-07-31 ‚Üí 2025-09-17) - high significance


### Interpretation

‚úÖ **Package B has better timeline continuity** (3 fewer gaps)

Fewer gaps indicate:
- More complete evidentiary coverage
- AI successfully linked events that string matching missed
- Better narrative coherence for legal analysis

‚úÖ **Package B has better sequence coherence**

More events (41 vs 25) organized into fewer, larger sequences (5 vs 9) indicates consolidated narrative rather than fragmented events.
