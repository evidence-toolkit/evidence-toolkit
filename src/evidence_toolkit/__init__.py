- **v3.1**: Power dynamics analysis in email communications
- **v3.2**: AI entity resolution, case type support, chunked summaries
- **v3.3**: Maximum Data Utilization (90-98% AI data surfaced)
- **v3.3**: Insights-first report structure
- **NEW v4.0**: 8 Professional Forensic Reports (automated generation)

Quick Start:
    from evidence_toolkit.core import EvidenceStorage, UnifiedAnalysis
    from evidence_toolkit.pipeline import analyze_evidence, PackageGenerator

    # Initialize storage
    storage = EvidenceStorage("data/storage")

    # Analyze evidence with v3.3 AI enhancements
    import openai
    client = openai.OpenAI()
    result = analyze_evidence(sha256, case_id, storage, client)

    # Generate client package with legal patterns
    generator = PackageGenerator(storage, client)
    package = generator.create_client_package(case_id, output_dir)

CLI Usage:
    evidence-toolkit process-case cases/MY-CASE --case-id MY-CASE

Architecture:
    - core/: Models (Pydantic), storage, utilities
    - analyzers/: Document, image, email, correlation analysis (AI-powered)
    - pipeline/: Ingest, analyze, correlate, package orchestration
    - generators/: [NEW v4.0] 9 report generators (8 professional reports)
    - domains/: Legal prompts and configurations

Reports Generated (v4.0):
    1. Executive Summary
    2. Forensic Legal Opinion
    3. Financial Risk Assessment
    4. Legal Patterns Analysis
    5. Timeline Reconstruction
    6. Quoted Statements Analysis
    7. Relationship Network Analysis
    8. Power Dynamics Analysis
