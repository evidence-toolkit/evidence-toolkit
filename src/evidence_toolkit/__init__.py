"""Evidence Toolkit v3.3 - AI-Powered Legal Evidence Analysis

A professional toolkit for forensic-grade evidence processing with:
- Multi-modal AI analysis (documents, images, emails)
- Content-addressed storage with chain of custody
- Cross-evidence correlation and timeline reconstruction
- **v3.1**: Legal pattern detection (contradictions, corroboration, evidence gaps)
- **v3.1**: Power dynamics analysis in email communications
- **v3.2**: AI entity resolution, case type support, chunked summaries
- **NEW v3.3**: Maximum Data Utilization (95%â†’98% AI data surfaced)
- **NEW v3.3**: Insights-first report structure (forensic summary, key findings, implications, actions)
- Professional client deliverables

Quick Start:
    from evidence_toolkit.core import EvidenceStorage, UnifiedAnalysis
    from evidence_toolkit.pipeline import analyze_evidence, PackageGenerator

    # Initialize storage
    storage = EvidenceStorage("data/storage")

    # Analyze evidence with v3.3 AI enhancements
    import openai
    client = openai.OpenAI()
    result = analyze_evidence(sha256, case_id, storage, client)

    # Generate client package with legal patterns
    generator = PackageGenerator(storage, client)
    package = generator.create_client_package(case_id, output_dir)

CLI Usage:
    evidence-toolkit process-case cases/MY-CASE --case-id MY-CASE

Architecture:
    - core/: Models (Pydantic), storage, utilities
    - analyzers/: Document, image, email, correlation analysis (AI-powered)
    - pipeline/: Ingest, analyze, correlate, package orchestration
    - domains/: Legal prompts and configurations
