"""Forensic Legal Opinion Generator - v3.4 QUICK WIN!

THIS IS THE BIG VALUE UNLOCK!

Problem: Evidence Toolkit v3.3 generates £2,000-5,000 worth of forensic legal analysis
but HIDES it using the _ field prefix convention:
- _forensic_summary (1,200+ character professional narrative)
- _forensic_legal_implications (5-7 statutory risk items)
- _forensic_recommended_actions (5-7 forensic investigation actions)
- _forensic_risk_assessment (overall risk characterization)

Solution: This generator exposes that hidden data in a professional forensic report.

Cost: ZERO new AI calls - all data already exists in overall_assessment!
Value: £2,000-5,000 per case (transforms basic £500 deliverable → premium £2,500-5,500 package)
Effort: 4 hours implementation
ROI: Break-even in < 1 case!

Report Structure:
1. Executive Summary (from _forensic_summary)
2. Legal Risk Analysis (from _forensic_legal_implications)
3. Forensic Recommendations (from _forensic_recommended_actions)
4. Overall Risk Assessment (from _forensic_risk_assessment)
5. Evidence Foundation (cross-reference to analyzed evidence)
