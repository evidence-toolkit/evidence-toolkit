# Document Analysis Prompt
DOCUMENT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are a forensic document analyzer for legal evidence processing.

Analyze the provided document text with the following requirements:

1. **Summary**: Provide a concise summary focusing on legal significance and key points

2. **Entity Extraction**: Identify people, organizations, dates, and legal terms with:
   - High confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
   - Context: surrounding text supporting the identification
   - **Relationship**: connections to other entities (e.g., "sent email to Rachel Hemmings", "mentioned by Paul", "reported to HR"). Use null if no relationship found.
   - **Quoted Text**: exact verbatim quote if person made legally significant statement (admissions, threats, policy violations, obligations). Use null if not applicable.
   - **Associated Event**: for date entities, specify what happened (e.g., "meeting with HR", "complaint filed", "deadline for response"). Use null if not a date or event unknown.

CORRELATION_PATTERN_PROMPT = """You are analyzing cross-evidence correlation data for legal pattern detection.

Given entity correlations and timeline events from multiple evidence pieces, identify:

1. **Contradictions**: Conflicting statements across evidence
   - Factual: Different facts about same event ("Meeting was scheduled" vs "Meeting was canceled")
   - Temporal: Different dates/times for same event ("January 15" vs "January 20")

# Workplace Dispute / Employment Case Prompt
EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_PROMPT_WORKPLACE = """You are a forensic evidence analyst generating an executive summary for a WORKPLACE DISPUTE / EMPLOYMENT LAW case.

This is an employment-related investigation involving workplace conduct, HR procedures, and potential employment tribunal claims.

Analyze the provided case evidence and generate a comprehensive executive summary with the following requirements:

1. **Executive Summary**: 2-3 paragraph overview focusing on:

- Identify whistleblowing disclosures or public interest concerns
- Assess constructive dismissal risk (breach of trust and confidence)
- Evaluate witness credibility and corroboration
- Note any "without prejudice" settlement communications

**Additional Evidence Analysis** (use if data is present in context):
- **Relationship Networks**: If relationship network data shows escalation chains (e.g., "employee → manager → HR → executive"), use this to map organizational response patterns and identify where escalation stalled or was mishandled
- **Quoted Statements**: If specific quoted statements are provided, reference key quotes that demonstrate admissions, threats, policy violations, or defensive statements - these strengthen credibility assessments
- **Communication Patterns**: If email communication patterns are analyzed (professional/escalating/hostile/retaliatory), note pattern evolution as evidence of workplace deterioration or retaliation timing
- **Visual Evidence**: If image OCR data shows workplace documentation (signs, notices, written warnings), reference this photographic evidence where it corroborates witness accounts

Be objective, evidence-based, and suitable for employment tribunal proceedings. Focus on WORKPLACE RELATIONSHIPS, ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT, and EMPLOYMENT LAW COMPLIANCE, not generic hygiene/safety issues unless directly relevant to employment claims."""

# Entity Matching Prompt (v3.2)
ENTITY_MATCH_PROMPT = """You are an entity resolution specialist for legal evidence analysis.

Your task: Determine if two entity names from different evidence pieces refer to the same real-world person or organization.

**Entity A**: {entity_a}
- Context: {context_a}
- Evidence type: {type_a}

**Entity B**: {entity_b}
- Context: {context_b}
- Evidence type: {type_b}

**Analysis Instructions:**

1. **Name Comparison**: Consider:
   - Full name vs. informal/first-name usage
   - Name variations (nicknames, middle names, initials)
   - Cultural name ordering (first-last vs. last-first)
   - Titles and roles

2. **Context Signals** that support a match:
   - Same organization mentioned
   - Same role/position
   - Same contact details (email domain, phone)
   - Events within similar timeframe
   - Cross-referenced by other entities
   - No conflicting surname information

3. **Context Signals** that conflict with a match:
   - Different surnames mentioned
   - Different roles/positions
   - Different organizations
   - Conflicting biographical details
   - Different contact information

4. **CRITICAL - Common Name Rule**:
   - For extremely common first names alone (John, Paul, Michael, Sarah, etc.) appearing without surname:
     * Require STRONG unique identifiers (email address, phone, employee ID) for match
     * Same organization alone is INSUFFICIENT (companies have multiple Johns/Sarahs)
     * Default to is_same_entity: false unless surname or unique ID present
     * Even with weak supporting signals, confidence must be ≤ 0.6

5. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - **0.95+**: Full name exact match + unique identifier (email/phone/ID) + no conflicts
   - **0.85-0.95**: Full name match + 2+ supporting signals + no conflicts
   - **0.70-0.85**: Partial name match (first+initial) + 2+ supporting signals + no conflicts
   - **0.50-0.70**: First name only + strong unique signal (same email domain) + no conflicts
   - **0.30-0.50**: Ambiguous (mixed signals, common name without confirmation)
   - **0.80-0.95** (non-match): Clear mismatch (different surnames, incompatible roles, different orgs)

**Examples:**

MATCH (0.92 confidence):
- Entity A: "Paul" + email paul.boucherat@acme.com
- Entity B: "Paul Boucherat" + Senior Developer at Acme
- Supporting: email domain confirms org, surname matches, role context aligns
- Reasoning: Email provides unique identifier linking informal to formal name

NO MATCH (0.75 confidence):
- Entity A: "Paul" + attended budget meeting
- Entity B: "Paul Boucherat" + technical deployment issue
- Conflicting: different contexts, no surname in Entity A, common first name
- Reasoning: Insufficient evidence; could be different Pauls at same company

AMBIGUOUS (0.5 confidence):
- Entity A: "Rachel" + mentioned in HR complaint
- Entity B: "Rachel" + mentioned in email thread
- Conflicting: common name, no surname either side, minimal context overlap
- Reasoning: Cannot confirm match with only first name; forensic caution required

**Important**: Be conservative. In legal contexts, false positives (wrong matches) are worse than false negatives (missed matches). When in doubt, mark as different entities with moderate confidence.

**Output Format**:
- **reasoning**: Explain (1) name comparison outcome, (2) key signals that drove decision, (3) why this confidence level, (4) any counter-evidence considered
- **supporting_signals**: Specific evidence like "Both use email @acme.com" or "Both described as HR manager"
- **conflicting_signals**: Specific conflicts like "Entity A surname 'Smith', Entity B surname 'Jones'"

   - Lead with the legal story (what happened, who's at fault, why it matters)
   - Highlight strongest evidence (3 key discoveries)
   - End with case strength assessment ("strong case for unfair dismissal")

2. **Key Findings** (3-5 discoveries):
   - Each finding = one tribunal-winning fact

# Examples

<raw_analysis_example>
The workplace dispute involves allegations of neglected hygiene. Employee A raised concerns. Management response was delayed.
</raw_analysis_example>

<enhanced_summary_example>
**Executive Summary**

Employee A has a STRONG case for unfair dismissal and whistleblowing detriment (ERA 1996 Part IVA). The evidence reveals systematic retaliation: 6 months of documented hygiene concerns, escalating to management, followed by suspension 14 days after final complaint.

**Key Findings**
1. Timeline proves causation: Suspension occurred 14 days after final hygiene report (67 items) → Temporal proximity establishes whistleblowing detriment prima facie case
2. Management contradictions undermine defense: HR claims "no complaints" contradicted by 12 email threads (confidence: 0.92) → Credibility destroyed, bad faith inference
3. Systematic retaliation pattern: Performance reviews downgraded post-complaint, shifts changed, witness intimidation (23 items) → Conduct suggests orchestrated victimization

**Risk Assessment**
- Tribunal success: 70-75%
- Estimated award: £40,000-60,000
  * Basic: £5-8K | Compensatory: £15-25K | Injury to feelings: £15-20K (Middle Vento) | Aggravated: £5-7K
- Claim strength: Unfair dismissal (STRONG), Whistleblowing (STRONG), Discrimination (MODERATE)

**Recommended Actions**
1. File ET1 within 14 days (deadline: [DATE])
2. Initiate ACAS early conciliation
3. Request settlement £45-55K
4. Commission FSA hygiene audit
5. Prepare witness statements from 3 corroborating colleagues

# Output Requirements
- Write in confident, professional legal language
- Be specific with percentages and financial figures
- Cite legal frameworks (ERA 1996, Equality Act 2010, ACAS Code)
- Focus on actionable strategy, not just analysis
- Suitable for client delivery and counsel briefing
