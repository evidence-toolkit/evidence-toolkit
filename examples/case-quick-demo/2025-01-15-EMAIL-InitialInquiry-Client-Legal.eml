Dear Legal Team,

I am writing to request a review of our service agreement with VendorCo, dated June 1, 2024.

We have identified several potential issues regarding service delivery timelines and quality standards that may constitute breach of contract.

Could we schedule a consultation to discuss this matter?

Best regards,
Alex Thompson
