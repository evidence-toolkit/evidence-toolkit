RE: Contract Review Matter - VendorCo Service Agreement

Dear Mr. Thompson,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the VendorCo service agreement.

We have conducted a preliminary review of the agreement dated June 1, 2024, and identified the following areas requiring further investigation:

1. Service Delivery Timelines (Section 4.2)
2. Quality Standards and Benchmarks (Section 5.1)
3. Remedies for Breach (Section 8.3)

To proceed with a comprehensive analysis, we will need:
- All correspondence with VendorCo regarding service issues
- Documentation of service delivery delays
- Records of quality standard violations
- Any previous attempts to resolve these issues

Please provide these materials at your earliest convenience so we can assess the strength of your potential claim.

We are available for a consultation on January 25, 2025, at 2:00 PM if that works for your schedule.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Martinez, Esq.
