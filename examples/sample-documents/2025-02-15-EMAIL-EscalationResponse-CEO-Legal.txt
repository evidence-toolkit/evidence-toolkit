Subject: RE: Case #2025-HR-003 - Executive Decision Required

Tom, Margaret,

I've reviewed the investigation findings and external counsel recommendations regarding the Smith v. Davis workplace harassment case. The board has expressed serious concerns about potential liability exposure and reputational risk.

EXECUTIVE DECISION:

Effective immediately, we will proceed with the following resolution strategy:

1. PERSONNEL ACTIONS:
   - Robert Davis will be placed on administrative leave pending final investigation completion
   - Jane Smith will report directly to VP of Engineering during transition period
   - Mandatory sensitivity training for entire development team

2. SETTLEMENT CONSIDERATION:
   - Authorize legal to begin settlement discussions
   - Maximum authorization: $150,000 plus confidentiality agreement
   - Include promotion opportunity and relocation assistance if desired

3. POLICY REVISION:
   - Accelerate review of harassment reporting procedures
   - Implement third-party reporting hotline
   - Quarterly sensitivity training for all management levels

BUSINESS RATIONALE:

The evidence pattern is concerning, and witness testimony creates significant litigation risk. The timing of HR's policy violation notice appears retaliatory and complicates our defense position. Early resolution protects both the company's reputation and limits financial exposure.

Margaret - please coordinate with legal on the administrative leave process and ensure all communications are documented appropriately. Tom - keep external counsel engaged through resolution and ensure all privilege protections remain intact.

I want this resolved professionally and fairly within 30 days. The company's commitment to a respectful workplace must be demonstrated through our actions, not just our policies.

Schedule a follow-up meeting for Monday to discuss implementation timeline and communication strategy.

Regards,

David Chen
