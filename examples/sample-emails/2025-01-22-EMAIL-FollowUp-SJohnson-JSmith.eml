Hi John,

Following up on our safety walkthrough last Friday. We've identified and addressed the following issues you reported:

1. Loose handrails on the loading dock stairs - repaired
2. Inadequate lighting in the storage area - additional fixtures installed
3. Blocked emergency exit route - cleared and marked

We will be implementing quarterly safety inspections going forward to prevent similar issues. Thank you for your attention to detail and commitment to workplace safety.

Please let me know if you notice any other safety concerns.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
