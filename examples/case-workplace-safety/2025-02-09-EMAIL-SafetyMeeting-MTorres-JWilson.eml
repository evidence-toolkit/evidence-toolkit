Hi James,

Following up on this morning's meeting regarding documentation procedures for Warehouse Area 3.

As discussed, we appreciate your diligence in identifying safety concerns. However, we need to ensure that any photographic documentation follows company policy:

1. Photos should be taken only during designated times
2. All photography must be reported to shift supervisor immediately
3. Images should be uploaded to the safety reporting system within 24 hours

We understand you were unaware of these procedures when you took the photos referenced in your February 2nd letter. Going forward, please follow the process outlined above.

The warehouse management team will be conducting a review of Area 3 conditions and will schedule appropriate maintenance as needed.

If you have any questions about the photography policy or safety reporting procedures, please let me know.

Thanks,
Michael
