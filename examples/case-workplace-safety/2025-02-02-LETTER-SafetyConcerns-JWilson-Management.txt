Subject: Workplace Safety Concerns - Warehouse Area 3
Date: February 2, 2025
From: James Wilson (Warehouse Associate)
To: Management Team
CC: Safety Department

Dear Management Team,

I am writing to formally document ongoing safety concerns in Warehouse Area 3 that require immediate attention. As a long-term employee with five years of service, I feel it is my responsibility to bring these issues to your attention.

SAFETY ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. Storage Area Conditions
- Multiple instances of damaged shelving units in Aisles 5-7
- Spillage not addressed within required timeframes
- Inadequate cleaning supplies available to warehouse staff
- Deep cleaning schedule not being followed consistently

2. Equipment and Training
- Staff members not receiving proper safety equipment training
- Documentation procedures for safety incidents unclear
- Disconnect between safety audit scores and actual floor conditions

3. Reporting Challenges
- Current reporting system does not account for time required for safety documentation
- Productivity metrics conflict with time needed for proper safety procedures
- Staff discouraged from reporting issues due to performance impact

DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED:

I have documented these issues through:
- Photographs of specific safety hazards (attached separately)
- Timeline of reported incidents over the past 3 months
- Observations from daily warehouse operations

REQUESTED ACTIONS:

1. Immediate inspection of Warehouse Area 3 storage conditions
2. Review of current cleaning and maintenance schedules
3. Staff training on proper safety reporting procedures
4. Revision of productivity metrics to account for safety compliance time

I am committed to maintaining both safety standards and operational efficiency, but current systems create an impossible conflict between these two essential requirements.

I am available to discuss these matters further and provide additional documentation as needed.

Respectfully,

James Wilson
Warehouse Associate, Area 3
