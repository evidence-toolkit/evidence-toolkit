Subject: Productivity Meeting Follow-up

Good morning James,

Following our conversation this morning, I have attached the meeting notes to this email.

Going forward to help with your productivity metrics, we have agreed you will flag items in the warehouse that need attention, communicate with a supervisor about the issue you have found for it to be addressed, and then return to complete your assigned tasks.

Kind Regards,

Sarah Chen
