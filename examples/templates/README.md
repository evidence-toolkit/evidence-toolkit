## Creating Your Own Evidence

### Step 1: Plan Your Case Structure

Decide what evidence you need:
- Initial complaint or incident report
- Email correspondence between parties
- Management responses
- Investigation documents
- Supporting documentation (notes, photos, etc.)

### Step 2: Create Evidence Files

1. **Copy templates** from this directory
2. **Rename consistently** using the naming convention
3. **Fill in content** replacing all placeholders
4. **Organize by date** to maintain timeline integrity

### Step 3: Organize in a Case Directory

```
your-case-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-01-15-EMAIL-InitialConcern-Employee-Manager.eml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-01-20-LETTER-FormalComplaint-Employee-HR.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-02-01-MEMO-InvestigationNotice-HR-Employee.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-02-15-EMAIL-FollowUp-Manager-Employee.eml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (optional case description)
```

### Step 4: Process with Evidence Toolkit

```bash
# Process your case
uv run evidence-toolkit process-case your-case-name \
  --case-id YOUR-CASE-ID

# View results
cat data/packages/YOUR-CASE-ID_*/reports/executive_summary.txt
```

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Use realistic but anonymized names
- ‚úÖ Include specific dates and timelines
- ‚úÖ Maintain professional language
- ‚úÖ Include relevant details (job titles, departments, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Create logical document progression

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Use real names, companies, or identifying information
- ‚ùå Include actual personal data (SSNs, real addresses, etc.)
- ‚ùå Create evidence with real legal cases (unless client case, kept private)
- ‚ùå Leave template placeholders (like [SUBJECT]) in final files

### Entity Consistency

For better cross-document correlation:
- **Use consistent names**: If "James Wilson" in one document, use "James Wilson" (not "J. Wilson" or "Jim Wilson") in others
- **Include job titles**: Helps with power dynamics analysis
- **Reference same locations**: If "Warehouse Area 3" in one doc, use same name elsewhere
- **Maintain timeline**: Ensure dates progress logically

### Email-Specific Tips

For `.eml` files:
- Always include From, To, Date, Subject headers
- CC relevant parties to demonstrate organizational hierarchy
- Use professional email signatures
- Create threads by referencing previous emails in subject/body

**Remember**: All evidence you create should be for legitimate legal work, training, or demonstrations only. Never fabricate evidence for actual legal proceedings.

**Privacy**: Keep all real case data in `data/cases/` (automatically gitignored). Only use these templates for practice, demonstrations, or anonymized training materials.
