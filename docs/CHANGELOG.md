uv run evidence-toolkit --version  # Should show 4.0.0
\`\`\`

**To regenerate existing cases with v4.0 features**:
\`\`\`bash
# Re-package existing case (no re-analysis needed)
uv run evidence-toolkit package --case-id MY-CASE

# Or run full pipeline
uv run evidence-toolkit process-case data/cases/MY-CASE --case-id MY-CASE
\`\`\`

### 2.x → 3.x
