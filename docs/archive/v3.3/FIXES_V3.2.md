# Evidence Toolkit v3.2 Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Issues Resolved**: Context length errors, unsupported file types

---

## Issue 1: Context Length Exceeded in Executive Summary

### Problem
Large cases (>1000 evidence items) failed executive summary generation:
```
Error code: 400 - context_length_exceeded
Your input exceeds the context window of this model
```

### Root Cause
The `_build_case_context_for_ai()` method concatenated all evidence summaries into a single prompt:
- 1384 evidence items × ~5 lines each = ~6,920 lines
- Plus 644 entity correlations + 2,647 timeline events
- Total: Exceeded GPT-4's 128K token limit (~150-200K tokens)

### Solution: Map-Reduce Chunking
Implemented hierarchical summarization pattern in `pipeline/summary.py`:

1. **Smart Threshold**: Cases ≤50 items use direct approach, >50 use chunking
2. **Map Phase**: Split evidence into chunks of 30 items
3. **Chunk Summarization**: Each chunk gets AI summary (ChunkSummaryResponse)
4. **Reduce Phase**: Combine chunk summaries into final context
5. **Graceful Fallback**: Failed chunks fall back to first 3 items

**Code Changes**:
- Added `ChunkSummaryResponse` Pydantic model
- Added `_summarize_evidence_chunk()` method
- Refactored `_build_case_context_for_ai()` to route to chunked/direct
- Created `_build_chunked_case_context()` for large cases

**Result**: Cases of any size now generate executive summaries successfully

## Issue 2: Video/Audio Files Classified as "other"

### Problem
Video files (`.mov`, `.mp4`) and audio files failed analysis:
```
⚠️  Failed to analyze 349a828f: Cannot analyze evidence type: other
```

### Root Cause
The `detect_file_type()` function in `core/utils.py` didn't recognize video/audio extensions, even though `EvidenceType` enum includes `VIDEO` and `AUDIO`.

### Solution: File Type Detection
Added video and audio detection:

1. **New Helper Functions**:
   - `is_video_file()`: Detects .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, etc.
   - `is_audio_file()`: Detects .mp3, .wav, .flac, .m4a, etc.

2. **Updated Detection Logic**:
   ```python
   def detect_file_type(file_path: Path) -> str:
       if is_email_file(file_path): return "email"
       if is_video_file(file_path): return "video"  # NEW
       if is_audio_file(file_path): return "audio"  # NEW
       if is_image_file(file_path): return "image"
       # ... rest of logic
   ```

3. **Analyzer Handling**:
   - VIDEO/AUDIO files now ingest successfully
   - Analysis skipped with informative message
   - Files tracked in chain of custody
   - Ready for future video/audio analyzer implementation

**Code Changes**:
- `core/utils.py`: Added `is_video_file()`, `is_audio_file()`
- `core/utils.py`: Updated `detect_file_type()` to check video/audio first
- `pipeline/analyze.py`: Graceful skip for VIDEO/AUDIO with helpful message

**Result**: Video/audio files ingest cleanly, no more "other" type errors

## Testing

### Large Case Test (1384 items)
```bash
uv run evidence-toolkit process-case data/cases/BCH_WORKPLACE_2025_1 \
  --case-id BCH_WORKPLACE_205_1
```

**Before v3.2**:
- ✗ Executive summary failed: context_length_exceeded
- ✗ 13 video files failed as "other" type

**After v3.2**:
- ✅ Executive summary generates with ~47 chunk summaries
- ✅ Video files ingest successfully (analysis skipped gracefully)
- ✅ All 1384 files processed

---

## Performance Impact

### Chunked Executive Summary
- **Small cases (<50 items)**: No change, uses direct method
- **Large cases (>50 items)**:
  - Map phase: N/30 OpenAI calls for chunk summaries
  - Reduce phase: 1 OpenAI call for final summary
  - Example: 1384 items = 47 chunk calls + 1 final = 48 total API calls
  - Trade-off: More API calls, but guaranteed success

### Video/Audio Detection
- **Ingestion**: <1ms overhead per file (mime type check)
- **Storage**: Files stored in content-addressed system
- **Analysis**: Skipped, no performance impact

---

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Cases
No migration needed! Existing cases will:
1. Automatically use chunked summarization if >50 evidence items
2. Video/audio files already ingested remain accessible
3. Re-run `package` command to regenerate executive summary with chunking

### For Future Development
Video/audio analysis placeholder ready in `pipeline/analyze.py`:
```python
elif evidence_type_enum in (EvidenceType.VIDEO, EvidenceType.AUDIO):
    # TODO v3.3: Implement video/audio transcription + analysis
    raise ValueError(f"Analysis not yet implemented for {evidence_type_enum.value}")
```

## Issue 3: Generic Executive Summaries Missing Case Context

### Problem
Executive summaries were too generic and missed the specific legal narrative:

**Example - Workplace Dispute Case**:
> "The case presents critical evidence of numerous hygiene and safety violations across a retail environment..."

**Issue**: The case was actually an **employment tribunal claim** (workplace dispute, grievance procedures, potential constructive dismissal), not a hygiene investigation. The AI focused on irrelevant details because the prompt didn't specify the legal domain.

### Root Cause
Single generic prompt for all case types in `legal_config.EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_PROMPT`:
- No domain-specific legal frameworks referenced
- No guidance on identifying parties (claimant/respondent)
- No employment law terminology or concepts
- Generic "legal significance" without context

### Solution: Domain-Specific Case Type Prompts
Implemented configurable case type system with specialized prompts:

1. **Case Type Registry**:
   ```python
   EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_PROMPTS = {
       'generic': EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_PROMPT_GENERIC,
       'workplace': EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_PROMPT_WORKPLACE,
       'employment': EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_PROMPT_WORKPLACE,  # Alias
       'contract': EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_PROMPT_CONTRACT,
   }
   ```

2. **Workplace Prompt Features**:
   - Focuses on employment law frameworks (ACAS Code, Equality Act 2010, PIDA)
   - Instructs AI to identify claimant vs. respondent
   - Maps grievance escalation timelines
   - Assesses employment tribunal claims risk
   - Evaluates procedural fairness and compliance
   - Avoids irrelevant hygiene/safety tangents

3. **CLI Integration**:
   ```bash
   uv run evidence-toolkit package --case-id MY_CASE --case-type workplace
   ```

4. **API Integration**:
   ```python
   PackageGenerator(storage, openai_client, case_type='workplace')
   SummaryGenerator(storage, openai_client, case_type='workplace')
   ```

**Code Changes**:
- `domains/legal_config.py`: Added case-specific prompt templates
- `pipeline/summary.py`: Added `case_type` parameter, selects prompt from registry
- `pipeline/package.py`: Passes `case_type` to SummaryGenerator
- `cli.py`: Added `--case-type` option to `package` command

**Result**: Executive summaries now tailored to specific legal domains with appropriate terminology, frameworks, and analysis focus.

### Example Comparison

**Before (Generic Prompt)**:
> "The case presents critical evidence of numerous hygiene and safety violations across a retail environment, specifically within Sainsbury's stores..."

**After (Workplace Prompt)**:
> "This case centers on an employment dispute between Paul Boucherat (Claimant) and Sainsbury's management (Respondent). Evidence reveals escalating workplace grievances from February 2025 through August 2025, culminating in suspension. Key employment law issues include potential constructive dismissal (breach of trust and confidence), procedural failures in the grievance process (ACAS Code non-compliance), and evidence of retaliatory conduct by management. Timeline analysis shows systematic escalation from initial HR complaints through fair treatment procedures to eventual suspension, raising significant employment tribunal risk..."

**Improvement**: Immediately identifies legal framework, parties, timeline, and relevant claims.
